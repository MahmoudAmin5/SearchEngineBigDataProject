Current assistant manager Stewart Yetton - who is the club's all-time record goalscorer - was part of the side that won at Wembley 18 years ago but says winning the National League South is a much greater achievement."Wembley was unbelievable, it was amazing the memories that we created that day," he said. "Winning that is very different to winning the league - we've won a league that we had no right to win."When we went up through the leagues for a few years, we had bigger budgets and we should have done it. We've just won a league where we've probably got a bottom-six, bottom-seven budget."This is the greatest achievement that Truro City has ever delivered - Cornwall's got its first National League club."Nomadic Truro City return home after four yearsPublished7 August 2024The Canadian owner out to follow Reynolds' leadPublished17 December 2024Few clubs can claim to have had the rollercoaster history of Truro City in the past 20 years.Under former owner Kevin Heaney, they stormed up the regional leagues in the West Country, winning five promotions in six years, and in 2007 were the first side to win a final at the newly-rebuilt Wembley Stadium when they beat AFC Totton 3-1 to win the FA Vase. Under Heaney's ownership they continued to climb the ranks until they reached what is now National League South in 2011.But as property developer Heaney's business suffered in the global economic crisis of the time, so did Truro, and the club went into administration in August 2012.They were hours from being expelled from the league before local businessmen Peter Masters and Philip Perryman stepped in and saved the club in October of that year.Thereafter, the team bounced between the Southern League and the National League South, and in 2014, the club's Treyew Road home was sold to developers.

Cornwall deserves it."'A long old poke'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, John Askey (left) and assistant Stewart Yetton have guided Truro City to their greatest-ever achievementComedian Paul Whitehouse once played a Plymouth Argyle fan in a car insurance advert, external - "a long old poke", he said when describing an away trip to Newcastle.Well for Truro fans - and those of their opponents next season - it will be even longer. Should Gateshead fail to progress through the National League play-offs, it would mean their 920-odd mile round trip to Truro would become the longest away journey in English football - comfortably beating Argyle's 815-or-so miles to Sunderland and back this season.Next season, Truro's 'local' derby will be a 280-mile round-trip to Yeovil Town - but many of the away days will be more than double that.There could also be lengthy journeys to Hartlepool United, York City, Boston United and Carlisle United, although none are as long as Whitley Bay's trip to Truro in the FA Vase in 2008 - a round-trip of more than 940 miles."I'll probably have to renew my passport and get a visa," joked manager John Askey."It would probably be the longest trips in English football that has ever been. "How we're going to navigate that I don't know, but we'll have to sort it out - it's a nice problem to have."Image source, Rex FeaturesBut for Askey, it more than vindicates what was seen as one of the most surprising non-league managerial appointment of last summer.The former Port Vale and Shrewsbury Town manager has had great success in the fifth and sixth tiers. He led Macclesfield Town to the National League title in 2018 and guided York City to promotion from National League North in 2022.But he had never managed a club based further south than Shrewsbury and never led a side in National League South - let alone one that had just moved to a new ground and had no idea about how many people would turn out to watch them.So what has been the secret of his success? "I think having honest players is a big thing," he said."The things that Truro have to put up with regards the travelling, training facilities, it's probably the most honest group of players I've ever had. They're amazing."To have achieved what they've achieved, that's probably why it gives me as much pleasure with this as it as with any promotion that I've had."Whatever club you go to you want to do well because it means a lot to supporters and means a lot to people who were running the football club, and obviously it means a lot to myself to win something."Related topicsFootballNational LeagueRelated internet linksTruro City FCTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9130 viewing9.1k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished3 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
