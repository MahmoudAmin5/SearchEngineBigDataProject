goalSecond-half strikes from Phoenix Patterson and Zech Medley helped Fleetwood Town to victory in their final home game of the season as Newport were beaten in their first match since the departure of head coach Nelson Jardim this week.County winger Bobby Kamwa curled an early effort wide before forcing a reaction save from Jay Lynch, while Newport keeper Nick Townsend also had to be alert to deny Ryan Broom and Matty Virtue.The match was temporarily suspended before half-time for a medical emergency in the stands, with both sets of players leaving the field for around seven minutes before play resumed.Fleetwood opened the scoring with a superb free-kick in the 52nd minute from Patterson, whose right-foot effort flew into the top-left corner.The hosts added a second with 16 minutes left when Medley tucked away Mackenzie Hunt's cross with a precise finish.Related topicsLeague TwoFleetwood TownNewport CountyFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable
