"You're probably looking at 47 points getting through into the top eight so we go away to Munster and away to Edinburgh to finish and we'll be fighting all the way to the end until there's nothing left to play for," said Murphy whose side have taken 38 points from 16 games. "I think we've shown that over the last number of weeks, there's been great commitment out of the lads."We've put some really good rugby together at times."The reverse against the Sharks, who featured eight World Cup winners in their side even with captain Eben Etzebeth ruled out through illness, was Ulster's third in a row in all competitions.Despite some spirited performances, Ulster have also lost to Bordeaux-Begles and Leinster during the run and Murphy said there could be no question that playing for the side "really means something" to his squad."The effort and the commitment and the heart that the lads are showing in relation to playing for Ulster Rugby, it really means something to this group," he added."That was questioned a number of months ago, but I would find that hard to question now. "I never questioned it myself but for people looking in, they must see a group of players who are working really hard and are completely committed to getting Ulster Rugby back to where we want to be which is in the top eight."22:13 26 AprilSharks defeat sums up Ulster's season - Stockdale, published at 22:13 26 AprilSharks defeat sums up Ulster's season - StockdaleAttributionUlster21:47 26 AprilHighlights: Sharks fight back to beat Ulster in URC.

It wasn't planned to be that long, so it was a tough one, especially the last two weeks with the boys playing so well."Kok is looking forward to a reunion with the Sharks, where he spent four years of his career.He admits he has been trying to give Ulster's coaches an "insight" into the Sharks, who have named a strong travelling squad for the trip to Belfast."I've been speaking to the coaches and trying to give them personal things I know about the guys [at Sharks], I was with them for four years so I know them in and out and hopefully we can capitalise on it," he added."I know 80% of their squad and I know what we're going to get, and they will know what they're going to get from me. "They're going to come with 11-12 Springboks, but if we're on top of our game we'll out work and out play them. We really need to get at least four points out of it so it's a really big game."Ulster's Lowry and Moore ruled out of Sharks gamepublished at 15:01 22 April15:01 22 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lowry and Moore were both taken off with concussion in the defeat against Leinster Full-back Mike Lowry and centre Stewart Moore have been ruled out of Ulster's United Rugby Championship [URC] game against Sharks on Saturday.Lowry was stretchered off in the 41-17 defeat against Leinster in the URC last weekend, requiring treatment after he tackled Robbie Henshaw in the build-up to Tommy O'Brien's try at the Aviva Stadium.He was taken to hospital, but Ulster head coach Richie Murphy said after the defeat that his scan was "OK".He will miss the home game against Sharks as he recovers from the neck injury sustained and from concussion.Moore was forced off in the opening 10 minutes of the Leinster loss after suffering a concussion and will be absent this weekend.Ulster also have a number of other injury doubts ahead of the Sharks game that they must win to boost their URC play-off hopes but Murphy said only Moore and Lowry have been ruled out at this stage. Stuart McCloskey dropped out of the starting team in Dublin after picking up a groin injury in the warm-up, while Rob Herring [calf] and Callum Reid [knee] had to go off injured in the bruising defeat.John Cooney also has an ankle problem before what would be his final home game as an Ulster player before departing for Brive in the summer."Quite a number of the lads who came off [against Leinster] trained and quite a few others sat out," said Murphy of Tuesday's session."We haven't ruled anybody else out. "We'll give them until Thursday to see where they're at. We just have to wait and see."O'Connor and Warwick among Ulster departurespublished at 12:48 22 April12:48 22 AprilImage source, InphoImage caption, Alan O'Connor and Andy Warwick have combined for 419 Ulster appearances Alan O'Connor and Andy Warwick are among eight players who will leave Ulster Rugby at the end of the 2024-25 season.The pair are two of 11 players who have represented the province more than 200 times.Dublin native O'Connor, who has regularly captained the side, joined Ulster in 2012 after representing the Ireland Under-20s and was named the side's player of the year in the 2020-21 season.Warwick, who came through the club's academy, made his senior debut in February 2014.  "Al [O'Connor] and Waz [Warwick] have been superb role models in the way they go about their work with a no-nonsense attitude and total commitment to the jersey over the years," said Ulster's general manager Bryn Cunningham."Both players hit the milestone of reaching over 200 caps for Ulster Rugby earlier this season, becoming members of that special club."As well as previously confirmed exits for John Cooney, Kieran Treadwell and Reuben Crothers, prop Corrie Barrett, scrum-half Michael McDonald and flanker Matty Rea will also be departing Kingspan Stadium at the end of the season.Ulster host the Sharks in the United Rugby Championship (URC) at Kingspan Stadium on Saturday evening needing a victory to keep pace in the race for the league's play-off spots. Head coach Richie Murphy feels that a last home game for some "incredible servants" to Ulster should provide added motivation. "For those guys that are leaving, the last chance to play here in this stadium is a big moment for them," he said."From the rest of the group, it probably focuses us in a little bit more. This is a huge game no matter what because we're fighting to get into that top eight."A little bit of added spice should be a good thing for us in relation of getting us on the edge."Ulster play-off chase like 'three finals' - Murphypublished at 08:28 21 April08:28 21 AprilAndy GrayBBC Sport NI JournalistThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Sheehan hat-trick as Leinster overpower Ulster in DublinHead coach Richie Murphy says Ulster face "three finals" in their bid to reach the United Rugby Championship play-offs.Their defeat by Leinster on Saturday leaves Murphy's side in 10th place in the standings, two points outside the all-important top eight.Ulster host the Sharks in Belfast this weekend and finish their campaign away to Munster and Edinburgh."Yeah, it definitely is," Murphy said when asked if Saturday's final home game of the season was a must-win for his side."It's very hard to know what you need to get into the top eight but 47 or 48 points will probably do it. "We're on 37 at the moment, so we'd be pretty happy with 10 or 11 points. Whether that be three wins or picking up a couple of bonus points, it's going to be very tight."Eight teams, six points, four spots - the URC's play-off raceAfter three consecutive league wins, Ulster had moved into sixth place heading into last weekend but have dropped to 10th after the 41-17 defeat by runaway leaders Leinster at the Aviva Stadium.Murphy will also have to contend with a number of injury concerns heading into the final stretch of the regular season, with backs Stuart McCloskey, Stewart Moore and Michael Lowry all injured in Dublin.Props Callum Reid and Andrew Warwick were also injured in the defeat, while hooker Rob Herring was replaced at half-time."We always said we would take each game as it comes," Murphy added. "Our big worry is what state our troops are going to be in. "I know they will bounce back mentally and we can physically freshen them up, but it's just where we sit with injuries."12:35 20 AprilWatch: Sheehan hat-trick as Leinster beat Ulster  Video, 00:03:00, published at 12:35 20 AprilWatch: Sheehan hat-trick as Leinster beat Ulster AttributionIrish Rugby3:0022:15 19 AprilLowry 'OK' after injury in Leinster loss - Murphy, published at 22:15 19 AprilLowry 'OK' after injury in Leinster loss - MurphyAttributionUlster21:34 19 AprilUlster's URC play-off hopes dented by Leinster, published at 21:34 19 AprilUlster's URC play-off hopes dented by LeinsterAttributionIrish RugbyUlster 'raise game' against Leinster - McCarthypublished at 08:13 19 April08:13 19 AprilImage source, InphoImage caption, Joe McCarthy is an integral player for Leinster and IrelandUnited Rugby Championship: Leinster v UlsterDate: Saturday 19 April Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Kick-off: 19:35 BSTCoverage: Live on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Foyle and the BBC Sport website and app from 19:30; also live text commentary on the BBC Sport websiteIreland second row Joe McCarthy says he believes Ulster "always raise their game" when they face Leinster as the sides prepare to lock horns again at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday evening.Leinster are heavy favourites for the interprovincial derby and head into the match off the back of a 52-0 win over Glasgow Warriors in the Investec Champions Cup.Leo Cullen's side lead the United Rugby Championship with 13 wins from 14 matches, while Ulster sit sixth after a recent resurgence in form."An interpro like this is great. I always find Ulster really raise their game against us and they will be looking to turn us over. "We are not short of motivation for this game. We want to put on a performance for the fans and beat Ulster." Leinster have momentum behind them and Saturday's quarter-final win over Glasgow in the Investec Champions Cup put their aggregate score over their last two-and-a-half European matches to 142-0. McCarthy says the province's recent defensive record is "class" and Leinster plan to "attack teams with our defence"."It feels really good that we have a bit of momentum with us, the pleasing thing is the lads are really hungry to get back to training," said the Ireland international."We want to rip into that and keep the momentum going. That's the good thing about the group, still hungry to improve."There will be no complacency here. We know we will have harder challenges ahead and we will have to be better, teams figure you out a bit more, so you have to be focused on improving."Treadwell 'soaking up everything' before Ulster departurepublished at 22:32 18 April22:32 18 AprilImage source, InphoImage caption, Treadwell has spent nine years at UlsterUnited Rugby Championship: Leinster v UlsterDate: Saturday 19 April Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Kick-off: 19:35 BSTCoverage: Live on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Foyle and the BBC Sport website and app from 19:30; also live text commentary on the BBC Sport websiteUlster lock Kieran Treadwell says he is "soaking up everything" in his last few months at the province.Treadwell, who joined Ulster in 2016 from Harlequins, will return to his former side at the end of the season.And the 29-year-old wants to savour his last few games in an Ulster jersey and inspire the province to a strong end to the season."You soak everything in, after Bordeaux I was like 'wow this is my last European game for Ulster,'" he told BBC Sport NI."I'm soaking up everything; the environment, the boys, the wins, the losses and the work we're doing on the training pitch."Treadwell said that the mood in camp is "good" despite their 43-31 defeat against Bordeaux in the last-16 stage of the Investec Champions Cup last time out."We still have disappointment from Bordeaux, we felt like we actually could have put a few more shots together and scored a few more tries," he added."I think we are going in the right direction, stringing some good play together, and defensively we are making strides, so hopefully that can snowball into this week."They face another tough assessment in the United Rugby Championship on Saturday as they face Leinster at the Aviva Stadium, but Treadwell, who starts the game on the bench, believes his side should look forward to the challenge."It's a different challenge and they pose different threats, but it is going to be a massive game, these games leading in are really important as the table is really tight and it's effectively play-off rugby now," he continued."I'd say they're one of the best, but most of the focus this week is going to be on us and how we can learn from Bordeaux."It's an occasion in a massive stadium and something we can be excited for but that we can't let get the better of us."Ulster's Izuchukwu and Postlethwaite return for Leinster trippublished at 12:35 18 April12:35 18 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Izuchukwu has been out since February while Postlethwaite has been sidelined since MarchUnited Rugby Championship: Leinster v UlsterVenue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 19 April Kick-off: 19:35 BSTCoverage: Live on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Foyle and BBC Sport website and app from 19:30; also live text commentary on the BBC Sport websiteFit-again Cormac Izuchukwu and Jude Postlethwaite have been named to start for Ulster in Saturday's United Rugby Championship game against Leinster in Dublin. Ireland forward Izuchukwu has been out since February with an ankle injury while Postlethwaite has been sidelined since March. Izuchukwu replaces Kieran Treadwell in the second row and Postlethwaite returns to partner Stuart McCloskey in midfield after James Hume was ruled out earlier this week because of a back injury. The only other change from Ulster's Investec Champions Cup last-16 loss to Bordeaux on 6 April sees Nathan Doak recalled at scrum-half, with John Cooney dropping to the bench. As expected, Leinster have made a raft of changes after thrashing Glasgow Warriors 52-0 in last week's Champions Cup quarter-finals, with only wing Tommy O'Brien, centre Garry Ringrose and lock Joe McCarthy retained. Caelan Doris, James Lowe and Jamison Gibson-Park are among those rested by Leinster boss Leo Cullen. However, Ireland internationals Dan Sheehan, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong and Sam Prendergast, and South Africa's RG Snyman, are all named on the bench. A three-match winning run in March moved Ulster up to the play-off positions in sixth spot as they defeated Scarlets, Dragons and Stormers, with the latter 38-34 win coming after the Irish province trailed 17-0 early on.However, it remains a congested table with 13th-placed Connacht only four points behind Ulster.Leinster have an eight-point cushion over nearest challengers Glasgow Warriors at the top of the URC table going into the weekend's action, having won 13 of their 14 fixtures to date.Line-upsLeinster: Osborne; T O'Brien, Ringrose, Henshaw, J O'Brien; Frawley, McGrath (capt); Boyle, G McCarthy, Clarkson; J McCarthy, Mangan; Soroka, Penny, Culhane.

"The two teams know each other and their strengths and weaknesses quite well so I expect it to be tight."Leinster are set to be without injured Ireland trio James Ryan, Jack Conan and Ryan Baird for the game.Leo Cullen's side have lost once in 20 matches this season in the URC and in Europe.Their form has been so strong, the aggregate score of their last three European matches is a remarkable 142-0.When asked if the games weren't competitive enough for Leinster, Nienaber said "it's a tough one to answer". "The reality is when the opponent is in front of us, we can't change it, it is what it is," said the World Cup winning coach. "For me making a comment that we aren't getting tested, what is that going to help? It is what it is and that is our mindset. We deal with it as best we can. "Glasgow and Harlequins were tough, and we gave them a lot of respect as we will give to Ulster because they are quality sides and if you get it wrong they can put you away."142 unanswered points - who can stop Leinster in Europe?Murphy 'relishing' starting role at Ulsterpublished at 06:47 18 April06:47 18 AprilImage source, InphoImage caption, Jack Murphy has started Ulster's past six games in all competitionsUnited Rugby Championship: Leinster v UlsterDate: Saturday 19 April Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Kick-off: 19:35 BSTCoverage: Live on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Foyle and the BBC Sport website and app from 19:30; also live text commentary on the BBC Sport websiteUlster fly-half Jack Murphy says that starting for the province and driving his side on is something he "relishes".The 20-year-old has established himself at Ulster this year after arriving last summer from Leinster.Murphy has started Ulster's past six games, scoring his first try against the Stormers last month, and he believes he is growing in confidence with regular game time.  "It's difficult coming in as a young guy, but the lads are really understanding with me, they want someone to drive them on and as an out-half that is your job and that is something I relish," he told BBC Sport NI."Getting a run of games has been massive for me, playing at that level in Bordeaux and in URC games, it's a higher level than what I have ever played so to get that experience is really good, and it has helped me grow as a player."Murphy says that he is "settling in really well" to life in Belfast and is not fazed by being coached by his father Richie Murphy at the province, having worked with him in a professional capacity before."In the [Ireland] under-20s last year he was coaching so I got used to that then and it's not a thing really, he is strictly my coach when I'm in here."The young fly-half is preparing for a return to his former side at the weekend as Leinster host Ulster in the United Rugby Championship (URC) at the Aviva Stadium.Murphy says that it will be a "special" occasion but that his side are focused on picking up a win which will help them move a step closer to qualifying for the URC play-offs. "There's loads of teams around eighth, and even down as far as 13th the points are really close, so we know picking up points is going to be vital over the next few weeks as it's really tight," he added."It's a good test for me and for the team to go against one of the best teams in the world."Ulster flanker Crothers to retire at end of seasonpublished at 15:15 16 April15:15 16 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Reuben Crothers has made seven appearances for UlsterFormer Ireland Under-20s captain Reuben Crothers will retire from professional rugby at the end of the season.The 23-year-old made the first of seven appearances for Ulster against Connacht in November 2023.He has featured twice this season, most recently in the victory over the Dragons at Rodney Parade last month.Crothers was captain of the Ireland Under-20s during the 2022 Six Nations and started all five games at open-side flanker as the side won a Grand Slam under now Ulster coach Richie Murphy. Ioane move a reminder of Leinster's unrivalled pullpublished at 14:25 16 April14:25 16 AprilMatt GaultBBC Sport NI Senior JournalistImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Reiko Ioane had a falling out with former Leinster and Ireland star Johnny Sexton in 2023Wednesday morning served up a startling reminder of the different worlds Leinster and the other Irish provinces currently inhabit. Merely an hour after All Blacks centre Rieko Ioane announced his shock move to Leinster for the 2025-26 season, Connacht confirmed the departure of head coach Pete Wilkins. Leinster are living under a cloudless, blue sky. They are top of the United Rugby Championship, are favourites to win the Investec Champions Cup and have an enviable squad that already includes an All Blacks star in Jordie Barrett - who will be gone by the time Ioane arrives - and a two-time World Cup winner in RG Snyman. The reality for Munster, Ulster and Connacht is quite different. In the past 12 months, all three have parted ways with their head coach mid-season. While Leinster target the biggest prizes, their Irish rivals are scrapping to even qualify for Europe's top competition next season. Even without the Wilkins news - which comes four days after Connacht's European Challenge Cup exit - the timing of the Ioane announcement is striking.On Tuesday, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) revealed another significant tweak to their central contract model: from August 2026, provinces must contribute 40% to central deals. Given that the union fully funded these deals up until a 30% requirement was introduced last year, it is significant. It was said that the IRFU "intends" that the funds generated by the change will be invested into the player pathways of Connacht, Munster and Ulster. The new model will certainly hit Leinster the hardest. As of next season, Leinster have 11 centrally contracted players, Connacht have two, Munster have one and Ulster none. Leinster will be contributing a healthy chunk of budget to those 11 Ireland internationals, but with Ioane taking Barrett's place next season, the anticipated increase to their wage bill has clearly not hampered their ability to recruit in the short-term.As well as Snyman, Leinster already have French prop Rabah Slimani on the books. With Ioane replacing Barrett next season, Leo Cullen will again be able to name a matchday 23 where reserve scrum-half is the only position not occupied by a current international from one of the game's four highest ranked Test teams.After losing three Champions Cup finals in three years, it is true that Leinster's change in approach to non-Irish qualified (NIQ) signings has been brought about their quest to win European rugby's biggest prize for a first time since 2018.But while the moves will draw envious glances from those in other countries trying to compete for the same trophies, there can be little doubt there will be a similar response much closer to home too.07:25 16 April'Leinster possibly the strongest team in the world' - Murphy, published at 07:25 16 April'Leinster possibly the strongest team in the world' - MurphyAttributionIrish Rugbyprevious pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
