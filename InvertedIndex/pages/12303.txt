Rory Hale's clever ball found Joe Gormley, who sent Luke Conlan racing clear down the left. Conlan's pinpoint cross was cushioned neatly by Ryan Curran into the path of Gormley, who calmly guided the ball into the far corner.Four minutes into the second half, Gormley doubled his tally following another slick move. Curran's incisive through-ball sliced open the Loughgall defence, releasing Axel Piesold, whose driven cross provided Gormley with an easy tap-in.The Reds then went further ahead on 64 minutes as Eric McWoods burst clear, drew goalkeeper Berraat Turker out and selflessly squared the ball for Alex Parsons to roll into the empty net.Darren Murphy's men responded swiftly, pulling one back moments later when Ryan Waide confidently dispatched a penalty, offering the home supporters brief hope of a comeback.However, Jim Magilton's charges restored their three-goal advantage eight minutes from time. The lively McWoods picked out Curran at the edge of the area, and he clinically swept the ball beyond Turker and into the far corner.Ports beat Sky Blues but miss out on play-off spotThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Portadown 2-1 Ballymena UnitedShay McCartan's penalty and Steven McCullough's free-kick either side of Luke Hawe's equaliser secured all three points for the Ports.The hosts broke the deadlock from the spot, with McCartan sending Sean O'Neill the wrong way from 12-yards as Eamon Fyfe was brought down inside the area.The visitors then found an equaliser 10 minutes before the break as Hawe found the bottom left-hand corner with his strike from outside the area following Daniel Lafferty's lay-off.Just as it looked like the two sides would go in level at the break, up stepped McCullough to curl home an exquisite free-kick with his left foot from just outside the box after Daithi McCallion accidentally used his hand.The second half was one of few chances, with the Ports hanging on for all three points.Portadown finished the season in eighth position, with Jim Ervin's Sky Blues a place behind in ninth.Campbell stars as Lurgan Blues beat CarrickThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Carrick Rangers v GlenavonGlenavon had the first attack on goal just three minutes into the game.David Toure swung in a cross from the right that had Carrick goalkeeper Jack McIntyre at full stretch to keep the ball out.However, on 16 minutes McIntyre could do nothing about Glenavon's opener.Paul McGovern raced clear and was half-tackled by Carrick's Benjamin Buchanan-Rolleston, but the ball rolled kindly back into his path allowing him to neatly slide the ball past McIntyre.Glenavon continued to dominate play and could have doubled their advantage nine minutes after, when a scramble in the Carrick box courtesy of some poor home defending, allowed McGovern to shoot, but he could only fire over the crossbar from 10 yards.Rangers' first chance came just before the break.  An in-swinging corner was met at the back post by Ben McFarland, but the midfielder failed to get his header on target.Just five minutes after the break Glenavon got their second. Ben Wilson produced a smart back-heel down the right flank which found Peter Campbell on the edge of the area, and he curled a left-footed effort that nestled into the bottom left-hand corner.There was still time for two more goals, first, after missing an open goal, Aaron Heaney was played in down the right by Campbell on 76 minutes, and the forward made no mistake, drilling the ball past McIntyre.Then on 85 minutes, Campbell once more cut inside from the right onto his favoured left foot before he bent a stunning shot into the far corner beyond the outstretched McIntyre.Stephen Baxter's side will now prepare for Tuesday's promotion/relegation play-off first leg away to Championship side Annagh United.Related topicsIrish FootballTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9920 viewing9.9k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished8 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
