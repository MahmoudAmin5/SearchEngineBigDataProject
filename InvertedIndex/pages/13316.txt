I love everything. But that I still take this decision shows you that I am convinced it is the one I have to take."It is that I am, how can I say it, running out of energy. I have no problem now, obviously, I knew it already for longer that I will have to announce it at one point, but I am absolutely fine now. I know that I cannot do the job again and again and again and again."Klopp 'convinced' leaving Liverpool now is 'right'Watch The Football News Show: Jurgen Klopp - End of an eraRecap all the best reaction to Klopp decision to leave Liverpool'A brilliant heart-on-sleeve boss who has taken Reds on thrill ride'Fans 'gobsmacked' at shock Jurgen Klopp news What are your favourite moments of Klopp's time at Anfield?

They beat Fulham on Wednesday to reach the Carabao Cup final."It didn't start [then], but of course last season was kind of a super-difficult season and there were moments when at other clubs probably the decision would have been, 'Come on, thank you very much for everything but probably we should split here, or end it here.' That didn't happen here, obviously," added Klopp.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Jurgen Klopp: Watch the Liverpool manager's best news conference quotes"For me it was super, super, super important that I can help to bring this team back on to the rails. It was all I was thinking about. "When I realised pretty early that happened, it's a really good team with massive potential and a super age group, super characters and all that, then I could start thinking about myself again and that was the outcome. It is not what I want to [do], it is just what I think is 100%."Liverpool assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz, as well as elite development coach Vitor Matos, will leave the club along with Klopp.Sporting director Jorg Schmadtke will leave at the end of the January transfer window, having been appointed in June.As well as being top of the Premier League and in the EFL Cup final, Liverpool host Norwich City in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday and are through to the last 16 of the Europa League."Let's squeeze everything out of this season and have another thing to smile about when we look back in the future," said Klopp."If you ask me, 'Will you ever work as a manager again?' I would say now, no," added Klopp."But I don't know obviously how that will feel because I never had the situation. "What I know definitely - I will never, ever manage a different club in England than Liverpool, 100%. That's not possible."Listen: The Black Forest boy who brought the glory back to AnfieldThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Jurgen Klopp: Liverpool manager tells Gary Lineker about his football philosophy'A body blow' - reaction to Klopp's departureMike Gordon, president of Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group, called Klopp's appointment "one of the greatest blessings of our time as owners"."First and foremost, on behalf of [principal owner] John Henry and [FSG chairman] Tom Werner, I would like to state our profound appreciation for Jurgen," said Gordon.  "It goes without saying that we will be hugely saddened to lose not just a manager of such calibre, but a person and leader for whom we have enormous respect, gratitude and affection. "At the same time, we fully respect his wishes and the reasons why he has decided the current season will be his last at Liverpool."Former Liverpool defender and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher posted on social media: "This news was always going to be a body blow to the club whenever it came. I just thought it would be another few years away. What a manager, what a man, let's go out with a bang Jurgen!"Former Reds striker Michael Owen echoed Carragher, posting: "All great things inevitably come to an end but I thought it would be two or three years down the line. Memories to last a lifetime. One of the greatest managers ever."Who next for Liverpool?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Alonso insists he's 'happy' at Leverkusen amid Liverpool speculationThe fact that Klopp told the club in November of his intention to step down means that preparations are likely to have begun on finding his replacement.Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso, who played for the Reds from 2004 until 2009, would appear to be an early favourite to take over from Klopp.The Spaniard is in charge of German side Bayer Leverkusen, who are four points clear of Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga having not lost a league game this season.Alonso, speaking before his side's game against Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday, said he was "surprised" by Klopp's decision but had "huge respect and huge admiration" for "what he has achieved and the way he has achieved that". On his own future, Alonso added: "I am really happy here. I am enjoying my work here. I am feeling that each day and each game is a challenge."We are in an intense, beautiful journey here in Leverkusen and I am trying to give my best to help my players to be ready for the next thing, that's my goal. What's coming? I don't know."To be honest, I am not in that moment thinking of the next thing. I think about where I am right now. I am in a great place. I am enjoying [it]. It's the right place so that's all I can say. "What's going to happen in the future I don't know.

Klopp can stand comfortably in the list of great Anfield managers.The news came as a bolt from the blue, especially having signed a contract extension taking him through to 2026 as a sign of his commitment to Liverpool.And it is even more stunning given how Klopp has rebuilt - or in his word "reloaded" - Liverpool so brilliantly this season that they are in the hunt for four trophies as Premier League leaders, in the EFL Cup Final against Chelsea, with a fourth-round FA Cup tie at home to Norwich City at what is sure to be an emotional Anfield on Sunday, as well as being Europa League favourites.Klopp's will be the hardest of acts to follow, not simply because of his bond with Liverpool's fans but also the ability which makes him one of football's greatest coaches, having brought the Champions League back to Liverpool in 2019 and their first title in 30 years 12 months later.In the meantime, however, the game is still coming to terms with the bombshell news that Klopp is on his way out of Liverpool.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, BBC Sport app: Download to follow all the latest on your Premier League teamImage source, BBC SportOur coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything Liverpool - go straight to all the best contentImage source, BBC SportRelated topicsLiverpoolComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 5940Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions10205 viewing10k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished19 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
