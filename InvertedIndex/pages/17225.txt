He was also the guest of honour at the annual Christmas lights switch-on in the town in November.Just a few months earlier however, Dunlop had signalled his intention to sit out the Armoy national road races, staged in a village only a few miles down the road, as a lingering dispute with the race organisers rumbled on.While many of the top exponents of road racing now ply their trade regularly on the short circuits which host the British Superbike series, Dunlop is a product of the more traditional route of racing on the narrow Irish road circuits where he and his famous racing family all honed their skills.Recently, he asserted his opinion that such events were "finished", although international road races like the TT and the North West 200 should survive.Such is the sometimes unpredictable nature of one of Northern Ireland's most decorated sporting stars of his or any other generation.Respected motorcycle road racing photographer and journalist Stephen Davison has known all the members of the Dunlop family well and recorded all of their successes."Michael has often said himself that he is like marmite - you either love him or not. He can be outspoken, he has that dimension to his personality," observed Davison."With Michael it's all about winning races and that fierce determination to succeed. That's the essence of what he is about, everything else is a sideshow. If anything or anyone becomes an impediment to that you can find yourself on the wrong side of the fence very quickly."His attention to detail and control over what happens on and off the track are essential in a sport where fractions of a second are the difference between winning and losing but also the difference between being alive and being dead."Image source, PacemakerImage caption, Dunlop pictured with some of the trophies he collected at the 2024 IOM TTAny discussion about Michael Dunlop's outstanding achievements in one of the world's most dangerous sports must be made in the context of his venerated racing family which has experienced both tragedy and triumph in huge measure.The name Dunlop represents road racing royalty, synonymous with speed and success.Michael's uncle Joey won 26 TTs and five Formula One World Championship titles before his death in a racing accident in Estonia in July 2000.Father Robert was a five-time TT winner and claimed 14 North West 200 victories, as well as a British 125cc championship, before losing his life in a crash at the North West in 2008.His brother William was a multiple NW200 and Ulster Grand Prix winner but died after an incident at the Skerries 100 races in the Republic of Ireland in 2018.A series of tragedies which would have steered most people away from the sport that had caused them so much heartache, yet still Dunlop continues to compete in the face of such adversity - and win.Perpetuating the family dynasty remains a huge motivation and his primary focus is very much the Isle of Man TT, an event which he has described as his 'Olympic Games'. That is the stage on which he wants to consistently perform.While others may be content with competing and raising their own standards, winning is what drives on the county Antrim man and as long as he remains in contention to do just that, he has indicated that he will continue.At just 34 and in a sport where experience counts for much, Dunlop potentially has plenty of time on his side to extend his winning record to heights previously thought unimaginable."Joey [Dunlop] was a much loved character and what other sporting star can you think of who did not attract negative headlines of any sort. It wasn't just his racing achievements, it was his mercy missions across Europe which all added to the legend. He appealed to everyone and his death was felt by everyone," observed Davison."Subsequently what Michael did in 2008 at 19 years of age, riding - and winning - a race at the North West 200 just two days after seeing his father, whom he idolised, killed in a practice session, was just an incredible thing to witness. Surely one of the most remarkable achievements ever in any sport."He has lived every day with intimate knowledge of the consequences of what can happen when it goes wrong in the worst possible way but sheer force of will and strength of character have seen him through those hard times."Image source, PacemakerImage caption, Michael Dunlop on board his Superbike machine at the 2024 Isle of Man TTMotorcycle road racing may always be regarded as being on the periphery of public consciousness compared with other more mainstream sports but increased exposure in recent years through additional television coverage, live streaming, marketing and social media presence have seen it expand its horizons.Despite his record-breaking high-speed exploits however, the name Michael Dunlop will hardly have come into the conversation when contenders for end-of-year ceremonies such as BBC Sports Personality of the Year were being discussed.But he remains a hero to motorsport fanatics across the world, exemplified by the homage paid by those who made the pilgrimage to the TT as he made history in 2024."If Michael's story was transferred to another sport like Formula One or football or some of the American sports it would be made into a feature film with Brad Pitt cast in a starring role," reflected Davison."His is one of the truly great sporting achievements but the fact that it is in a niche sport in a relative small backwater like Northern Ireland means that hasn't happened."Related topicsMotorsportNorthern Ireland SportMotorbikesTop storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions9719 viewing9.7k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published14 hours agoEubank discharged from hospitalPublished27 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCA gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean BeanLouis Theroux visits the West Bank to meet Israeli settlersPanorama investigates the truth about baby food pouchesThe Doctor and Belinda face absolute terrorElsewhere in Northern Ireland sportThe 'rugby student' stepping up to lead IrelandPre-contract agreements - why are they different in NI?Record-breaker Dunlop 'breaks mould' of modern sporting heroesMeet Jude McAtamney - the New York Giants kicker from Derry Elsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
