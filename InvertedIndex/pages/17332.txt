The 21-year-old has been sidelined after being forced off with a hamstring injury in Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Aston Villa in February.Liverpool manager Arne Slot said Bradley was back in training after missing six matches but he would have to be "smart" about his involvement at Anfield."We have to make a decision on whether he is playing, and if playing means coming in or starting," Slot said in Tuesday's press conference."That's something I keep for myself. He's only had a few sessions after being out for quite a long time with a repetitive injury so we have to make a smart decision."With Trent Alexander-Arnold and Bradley injured, Jarell Quansah started at right-back in Liverpool's Carabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle United.Bradley also missed Northern Ireland's friendlies with Switzerland and Sweden in March with the issue. Liverpool hold a 12-point lead at the top of the Premier League with nine matches remaining. Brazil goalkeeper Alisson and Netherlands midfielder Ryan Gravenberch are expected to be available for the derby despite withdrawing from their international squads. "Ryan is OK. We have to train one more time but he is OK," added Slot. "Ali trained with us as well. The last check has to be made this afternoon, after the session, to see if he is available to play."'Lessons to be learned' from Sweden loss - McNairpublished at 06:06 27 March06:06 27 MarchAndy GrayBBC Sport NI Journalist in StockholmImage source, InphoPaddy McNair says there are "lessons to be learned" from a "tough night" in Sweden as Northern Ireland fell to a 5-1 defeat on Tuesday.Newcastle striker Alexander Isak scored and assisted in Stockholm, while Emil Holm, Benjamin Nygren, Ken Sema and Anthony Elanga were also on target.Isaac Price scored a late consolation, but Northern Ireland fell to just a third defeat in 12 matches as Sweden showed their clinical edge."We're disappointed but it's a hard one," said San Diego defender McNair."They deserved to win but I felt 5-1 was a bit harsh."We have to learn from that and move forward because there are still six months to the World Cup qualifiers, so we can iron out the mistakes and get it right for then."'You are going to have nights like this'Manager Michael O'Neill had warned that his side - also missing a number of key players such as Conor Bradley, Trai Hume and Daniel Ballard - could face difficult nights as he gears up for the start of World Cup qualifying with a series of friendlies with top-tier nations.That proved to be the case in Stockholm as Sweden, who lost to Luxembourg on Saturday, responded with a big win in front of a home crowd."They are a good side obviously and took their chances," added McNair."I think they had six on target and scored five of them so they were clinical and it was disappointing for us."When you are young players you are going to have nights like this, and you have to learn from them and take the small positives from it."NI 'good enough' to compete with top teams - Charlespublished at 18:30 26 March18:30 26 MarchAndy GrayBBC Sport NI Journalist in StockholmImage source, Press EyeImage caption, Shea Charles captained Northern Ireland in StockholmShea Charles believes Northern Ireland have to use Tuesday's 5-1 friendly defeat in Sweden as motivation for their World Cup qualifiers.The loss in Stockholm was just a third in Northern Ireland's past 12 matches as Alexander Isak spearheaded a wounded Sweden, who lost on Saturday in Luxembourg, to a big win.Michael O'Neill's side will face two more friendlies, away to Denmark and at home to Iceland, before their opening World Cup qualifiers in Luxembourg and Germany."Definitely. It's almost like a look into the future of what we will come up against," said Charles when asked if the defeat would fuel their qualifying campaign."I know Germany are one of the best teams in the world but it's a game of football and anything can happen."I think we are good enough to compete against these sorts of teams."'They finished their chances, we didn't'While it may be a strange statement to say after a 5-1 defeat, Northern Ireland showed in Friday's draw against Switzerland that they can match sides who are regulars at major tournaments.O'Neill's team have also impressed against the likes of Scotland and Romania in the past 12 months, but the game in Sweden was a harsh lesson.Charles, who captained the side at 21, is confident it will not leave any lasting impact on a young panel who had been on an upward trajectory."I don't think it was a 5-1 game, which is always hard to look at when it is that score," he said."They finished their chances, unlike us. I feel that we had similar chances."Northern Ireland were without three first-choice defenders in Conor Bradley, Trai Hume and Dan Ballard, while Eoin Toal also likely would have featured if fit."We should have been a bit more compact, but we didn't and it ended up being five," added Charles."That's what that's what happens when you do make mistakes against players of that quality."Sweden's Elanga impressed by Northern Irelandpublished at 14:14 26 March14:14 26 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Anthony Elanga (right) scored in the 77th minute of Sweden's 5-1 win over Northern IrelandSweden's Anthony Elanga said Northern Ireland are a "really good young team" and praised goalkeeper Pierce Charles, despite dominating Michael O'Neill's young side in the Stockholm friendly.Nottingham Forest striker Elanga was on the scoresheet in Sweden's 5-1 win on Tuesday night, but thinks the beaten visitors are heading in the right direction under O'Neill."I've been watching Northern Ireland and I think they're really good, they've got a really good manager."You've got a really good, young team that play football, play good football. I really enjoy watching you guys play."Elanga knows a number of O'Neill's squad and believes 19-year-old goalkeeper Charles, who won his sixth cap at the Strawberry Arena, is an "amazing" prospect."I know a few of the players, Ethan Galbraith who I played with at [Manchester] United, the Charles brothers [who were products of the Manchester City youth system]."He [Pierce] is an amazing goalkeeper by the way, he's got a bright future."Sweden's victory came without Tottenham winger Dejan Kulusevski and Sporting Lisbon striker Victor Gyokeres.Elanga said he was "not at all" frustrated to start the game on the bench, especially with Nottingham Forest's FA Cup quarter-final against Brighton on Saturday."Coming on, I wanted to make an impact and score and that's what I did."It's important to stay fit and healthy because I've got a lot of games coming up for Nottingham Forest."Hale will get chances with NI - O'Neillpublished at 12:26 26 March12:26 26 MarchImage source, InphoImage caption, Ronan Hale has scored 12 goals in all competitions for Ross County this seasonNorthern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill said he had to avoid the team becoming "very disjointed" after not bringing Ross County striker Ronan Hale off the bench in his side's 5-1 friendly loss to Sweden on Tuesday night.The former Cliftonville man was the subject of a lengthy international transfer after previously representing Republic of Ireland at youth level and was included in O'Neill's squad for the first time this month.But the 26-year-old was an unused substitute in friendlies against Switzerland and Sweden with O'Neill saying he did not want to bring him on "slightly out of position" in the latter stages with the team already 5-0 behind."It's very difficult in that situation," he said. "You can throw on another player and play him slightly out of position, but at that time we're trailing in the game 5-0. "I have to protect the morale of the team a little bit, the team can get very disjointed at that point in time."O'Neill added that Hale will have benefitted from the experience of being away with the squad for the first time.He said: "Those players will get their chances. "They will go back to their clubs, they have to get minutes and do well. "This is Ronan's first trip, he will understand what we want from him from what he's seen in training."06:42 26 MarchNI exposed to 'level above' in Sweden loss, published at 06:42 26 MarchNI exposed to 'level above' in Sweden lossAttributionIrish Football21:37 25 MarchInexperience showed in Sweden defeat - NI boss O'Neill.

"They had some great moments, some great goals - Isak's in particular," said O'Neill. "We need to defend better. As a back three we didn't defend great, as a back five we didn't defend great in terms of our decision-making."Sweden led 2-0 at half-time courtesy of their only two shots on target in the opening 45 minutes, while McConville missed a great chance for the visitors with a header just before the break."I didn't think in the first half there was a lot in it. They had two shots and scored two goals," O'Neill said."We've two shots, the keeper makes a save and the other misses the target."It wasn't as if we were relying on our keeper to make a load of saves or anything like that."'We're missing players that will make a difference'O'Neill said he had taken the friendly against Sweden to "expose the players" to a higher level than they faced in Nations League C during the autumn, but felt that injuries cost his side at the Strawberry Arena. Northern Ireland were without Liverpool's Conor Bradley and Sunderland duo Trai Hume and Dan Ballard in defence. Midfielder Ali McCann and striker Dion Charles were also absent through injury. "We're missing players that will make a difference to the team, probably five or six players, potentially starting players," O'Neill added.Northern Ireland are next in action with a pair of June friendlies against Denmark away and Iceland at home.21:17 25 MarchFive-star Sweden cruise past NI in Stockholm.

Northern Ireland's next games after Tuesday are friendlies with Denmark and Iceland in June. ONeill added: "It's not something that we want, or Sunderland want, to drag on."They've got a lot to play for and we would not want him to come here and subsequently miss the games in June either."Northern Ireland's only other injury doubt after the Switzerland draw is midfielder Ethan Galbraith who sat out training on Monday.O'Neill said the Leyton Orient man's absence at the Strawberry Arena was a "precaution".Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Shea Charles will captain the side for the third time  in the game having previously worn the armband in Nations League games against Belarus and Luxembourg in November. Germany as 'tough as it gets' for NI - O'Neill published at 16:42 24 March16:42 24 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Northern Ireland last played at a World Cup in 1986Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill says his side must "embrace the challenge" of being drawn against Germany in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.Germany's 5-4 aggregate victory over Italy in the Nations League quarter-finals last week confirmed that Northern Ireland's campaign to reach next summer's tournament in the USA, Mexico and Canada will pit them against the four-time champions, as well as Luxembourg and Slovakia. "It'll be a tough, tough challenge," O'Neill told BBC Sport in Stockholm, where his side face Sweden in a friendly on Tuesday evening (18:00 GMT)."You're probably wanting to avoid Germany but we have to embrace the challenge."A group with ourselves, Slovakia, Luxembourg and now Germany at the top of that, will provide the stiffest of tests for us."Northern Ireland have lost their past eight competitive games against Germany, including five during O'Neill's first spell in charge of the team between 2011 and 2020."It's as tough as we could get, let's be honest," he added."We've played them in my previous reign. We had five games against them and we never managed to take anything."I think in a lot of those games we gave a good account of ourselves."O'Neill confirms Denmark tripAfter drawing with Switzerland on Tuesday, Northern Ireland have three remaining friendly fixtures before that qualifying campaign begins with a trip to Luxembourg on 4 September. Nations League results over the weekend also confirmed their June schedule with an away game in Denmark now to be played in addition to hosting Iceland on 10 June. "We'll have had a real Scandinavian flavour between March and June," O'Neill said. "Again, a good test. We played them recently in [qualifying for] Euro 2024 and it's good exposure for the team."We're testing ourselves, we're not taking easy games and we'll hopefully see the benefit of that in September." 12:28 24 MarchWho stands between Northern Ireland and the 2026 World Cup?, published at 12:28 24 MarchWho stands between Northern Ireland and the 2026 World Cup?AttributionNI Men'You want to play the best' - Spencer on Sweden testpublished at 06:55 24 March06:55 24 MarchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Defender Brodie Spencer won his 14th Northern Ireland cap against SwitzerlandInternational Friendly: Sweden v Northern IrelandVenue: Strawberry Arena, Stockholm Date: Tuesday, 25 March Kick-off: 18:00 GMTCoverage: Watch live on BBC iPlayer and BBC Two NI, listen on BBC Sounds and live text commentary & in-play clips on the BBC Sport websiteNorthern Ireland defender Brodie Spencer says he is looking forward to testing himself "against the best" when they take on Sweden in Tuesday's friendly.Michael O'Neill's young side drew with Switzerland on Friday as their positive run of form continued.After topping their Nations League group, Northern Ireland have now lost just two of their past 11 matches.While Sporting striker Victor Gyokeres is expected to be out, Newcastle forward Alexander Isak is in a strong Swedish squad for the game in Stockholm."You want to play against the best, to test yourself and see where that puts you," Spencer said on playing top-tier opponents. "Being a young defender, to have that challenge so early in my career would be amazing." After Isaac Price's superb opener was cancelled out by Vincent Sierro, the 20-year-old said Northern Ireland were "happy" with a draw against Switzerland but "we could have got a bit more out of the game".With Isak and Nottingham Forest's Anthony Elanga leading the line, Sweden suffered a shock 1-0 defeat by Luxembourg on Friday.Spencer believes the friendly, which will be the latest in preparation for the start of 2026 World Cup qualifying in September, will be "quite similar" to facing the Swiss."It will be a tough game and a game full of concentration," said the Huddersfield Town right-back."It will be a game full of important moments, and hopefully we can go out and put on a good performance again."We knew we had to try and kick on from the Nations League.
