They made an extraordinary 232 tackles compared with Ireland's 85.The defence of their try line was colossal, holding the Irish up over the line on three occasions and producing crucial turnovers near the line on a couple of occasions just as they looked likely to concede.It was an utter refusal to be beaten and the fact they kept their composure to engineer the chance to send Francesca McGhie over for the winning try at the last was a fitting reward for such a monumental effort.McLachlan makes her markIt was no surprise to see Rachel McLachlan collect the player-of-the-match award. She was immense.She made an astonishing 29 tackles, the most of any Scotland player, and led the way in metres made (62).McLachlan was a constant threat with ball in hand, making the hard yards and also popping up in the wide channels to great effect, most notably for her well-taken try.Her performance typified the doggedness and spirit shown by the Scots to navigate a path through choppy waters to a dramatic victory.Win perfect pre-World Cup boostThe defeat to Italy in round three threatened to cast a shadow over Scotland's entire Six Nations, so to end the tournament on such a high will come as a huge relief to head coach Bryan Easson.Had they gone into the World Cup in August off the back of a campaign of one win from five, it would have been difficult to claim the Scots had any momentum to carry into the tournament.As it is, the win over a very good Ireland side, and the nature of it, should do wonders for the confidence of the team.Easson and the players won't get carried away. The three defeats, especially the one at the hands of the Italians, highlighted areas Scotland need to improve if they are to compete on the biggest stage of all.That said, they will go into pre-World Cup camp in much better spirits after their heroics at the Hive on Saturday.Glasgow 19-26 Bulls: Three things we learnedpublished at 09:5309:53Andy BurkeBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterImage source, SNSSamuel stands up to rampaging BullsOn a night when the brutally physical Bulls defence suffocated much of Glasgow's attacking impetus, Alex Samuel led the charge to try and get his side on the front foot.The big lock carried hard into the guts of the Bulls all night and with his team-mates getting smashed back in the tackle left, right and centre, he was one of the few that put some dents in the wall of South African beef.At just 22, Samuel has a big future but it's in the here and now that Glasgow need him, with senior figures dropping like flies through injury in recent times.He is tough and aggressive, qualities Franco Smith values highly.Injured stars emerging from treatment roomGlasgow have looked jaded in recent weeks and the desperate injury list seems to be taking a toll.Mercifully, some of those big hitters who have been kicking their heels on the sidelines are on the way back.Scott Cummings made his return off the bench against the Bulls, and with Max Williamson also back in action and Samuel stepping up to the plate, the second row is starting to look well stocked once again.Sione Tuipulotu should be back for the final regular season match away to Leinster, and Smith hopes to see Huw Jones and Jack Dempsey return sooner rather than later.The hope is these returning stars can give Warriors renewed energy for one big final push at the business end of the season.Uphill task to make top twoDefeat to the Bulls has left Glasgow with an uphill task to seal a top-two spot and the potential home semi-final that comes with it.The losing bonus-point snatched at the death - which kept Glasgow in second place, a point ahead of the Bulls - could yet prove crucial, but looking at the respective run-ins for both teams, you have to think it's the South African side who are in the box seat.They have a relatively favourable final two matches, at home to Cardiff and Dragons, while Glasgow face tough away trips to take on Benetton and Leinster.Given Warriors' last visit to Dublin ended in a 52-0 drubbing in the Champions Cup quarter-final, it's hard to see an away win in the final round.Whether it's in the final two regular season matches or in the play-offs, Glasgow will need to find some of the away day magic that propelled them to the URC title last season.'Game too far' for Glasgow & Edinburgh 'abject' in drawpublished at 13:08 27 April13:08 27 AprilWe asked for your views on as Glasgow Warriors suffered defeat and Edinburgh drew in their weekend of URC action.Here's what some of you said:Glasgow Warriors 19-26 BullsBen: After Glasgow's trip to South Africa last year, I felt very deflated and went into the play-offs feeling hopeful more than anything. I probably feel a bit worse this year. The only reason to be hopeful is that our missing players come back strong, but we will likely need to go away to South Africa in a semi-final, then away to Leinster in a final - tough ask!Alistair: Warriors didn't have a plan B to counter Bulls' impressive defence. Tactical field kicking was poor as it simply returned the advantage to Bulls. I wouldn't criticise Tom Jordan for kicking the penalty dead but I would for the decision not to take the three points. Three on the board would have kept them in the game and have had the ball returned to them. Warriors looked the fitter of the two teams but just need to make better on-field decisions. The return of Huw Jones and Sione Tuipulotu can't come soon enough.Anthony: It looked like a game too far for the injury-depleted Warriors squad. They struggled to break the gain line against a ferocious Bulls defence. Bulls coaching staff deserve credit for getting their tactics spot on and not allowing Warriors to play their normal, expansive attacking game. Bulls also had Johan Goosen as a very good goal kicker, while Jordan had a night to forget. Full credit to Warriors to show the heart and desire to claim an important bonus point right at the end. Worrying injuries to Kyle Rowe and Gregor Brown, but is was good to see Scott Cummings back on the field. This match was a brilliant learning curve for many of the younger squad members against a very good, physical Bulls team. Warriors have earned their two-week break before the Benetton match, which is a must win.Bert: The Bulls scrum dominance was a major issue for Warriors. No matter how good your backs are they are going to struggle behind that weakness. While Warriors' penalty dogma of always going to the corner can be seen as positive, it surely has to be flexible for games like this where it was all about the win. The risks were fully evident when Jordan's second-half kick flew dead, scrum penalty again, and try scored from the lineout to effectively cost us nine points.Zebre 25-25 EdinburghSteve: To put some perspective on Edinburgh's fairly abject draw with Zebre, there was one very depleted looking 23 versus a pretty well-stacked Italian outfit. Zebre are a different team this year but the feeling is that's another four or five points gone abegging. I have to question the nature of the squad rotation and perhaps it's a case that Europe is indeed being prioritised. We'll have to be very, very good to beat Bath, so I hope it's worth it. It has to be because the URC is effectively over unless three or four teams all do us a massive favour. Another frustrating season so far, but in our hearts we knew it was going to be.Domenic: Edinburgh are a basket case. Inconsistent and at times appalling to watch. Quite simply successful teams beat those below them, unsuccessful ones don't. So, when do the SRU say enough is enough and clear out the hierarchy of Edinburgh Rugby from chief executive to coaching team? A £6m budget for this? Too many years of failing to reach potential, in any other walk of life you'd be shown the door.10:47 27 AprilWho's in, who's out? - the URC's dramatic play-off race, published at 10:47 27 AprilWho's in, who's out? - the URC's dramatic play-off raceAttributionRugby UnionComments110'Heart' and 'outstanding defence' earns Scotland victorypublished at 19:17 26 April19:17 26 AprilImage source, SNSImage caption, Scotland players celebrate their second victory in this year's Six Nations"It just shows the fight of this team."An emotional Bryan Easson was full of praise for his Scotland team after finishing an up and down Six Nations campaign with a thrilling 26-19 win over Ireland in Edinburgh.Francesca McGhie scored the decisive try late on, with Lana Skeldon, Emma Orr and Rachel Malcolm also touching down in a bonus-point success.Scotland had been targeting three home wins this year and beat the Welsh in the tournament opener.However, they fell to a disappointing loss to Italy in between defeats on the road against France and England.Ireland put the hosts under pressure for long spells but the Scots were belligerent and well-organised."Defensively, we were absolutely outstanding, some of the turnovers, and we deserved everything we got because of the heart in that team performance," head coach Easson told BBC Sport"We've had a couple of difficult performances in the tournament and we drew a line under the England game as soon as it finished. It was all about this week and fighting for each other."Player-of-the-match Rachel McLachlan echoed those sentiments, saying: "There have been some downs in this campaign and we wanted to come out and show heart and pride in the jersey."We knew we had it in us and it's massive to finish with a win."Glasgow will have to 'do it hard way' to win URCpublished at 18:50 26 April18:50 26 AprilAndy BurkeBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterImage source, SNSGeorge Horne says Glasgow Warriors will have to "do it the hard way" all over again if they are to retain their United Rugby Championship title.Warriors are chasing a second-place finish in the regular season behind Leinster, the reward for which would be a potential home semi-final in addition to a home quarter-final, which they have already secured.However, a 26-19 defeat at home to the Bulls on Friday night saw the South Africans close to within a point of Glasgow in the URC table.Warriors face tough away matches at Benetton and Leinster in their final two matches, with the Bulls having a more favourable run-in with home matches against Cardiff and Dragons.Franco Smith's side produced fantastic away play-off wins over Munster and Bulls en route to winning the title last season, and Horne believes they are capable of more end-of-season heroics."It's still in our hands," Horne told BBC Scotland."We're still ahead (of Bulls) in the table, but we're going to have to keep getting better coming into the last two games."You would back Bulls to win both their games at home, so we're going to have to do it the hard way. We've got a bit of experience doing that now, but that counts for nothing this year."We're just going to have to knuckle down and just go out and give it everything. We're going to probably need 10 points from the last two games."16:38 26 AprilScotland edge out Ireland with last-minute McGhie try, published at 16:38 26 AprilScotland edge out Ireland with last-minute McGhie tryAttributionRugby UnionComments6822:25 25 AprilEdinburgh snatch late draw away to Zebre, published at 22:25 25 AprilEdinburgh snatch late draw away to ZebreAttributionEdinburghGlasgow secure losing bonus point while Edinburgh rescue draw: Have your saypublished at 22:09 25 April22:09 25 AprilIt was a night of late drama in Scottish rugby as Glasgow scored two consolation tries to secure a losing bonus point against the Bulls, while Edinburgh scored an 82nd minute conversion to rescue a draw with Zebre out in Parma.What did you think, rugby fans? What went wrong for Glasgow for most of that match? Have injuries caught up with them?Did you foresee Edinburgh rescuing that against Zebre? And how about Cammy Scott's clutch kick?Let us know your thoughts here. Glasgow Warriors 19-26 Bulls: What Smith saidpublished at 22:03 25 April22:03 25 AprilImage source, SNSGlasgow head coach Franco Smith tells BBC Scotland: "We must expect this from URC, not just the Bulls. There is quality sides pushing each other every week."We've done well to be second for a long time. If we face the previous finalists of last year, you'd expect a tough game. The game got away from us. When we missed touch with the score at 9-7, we gave away two tries in the space of 15 minutes."I'm still proud of the effort, the boys kept on playing until the end. We ended up pushing for a bonus point. Very happy that we didn't give up and kept working hard, which is the character of this team."The Bulls came here with a mission. They made 189 tackles tonight, 80 more than we did. Despite that, we got so many line-breaks but they scrambled well to defend. Compliments to them. They forced us into errors."We are at the back end of a very tough season, we've played 16 finals. Every team wants to beat last year's winners, it's a different aspect of the game. We're still second with two to go, so I'm really proud of what the boys have achieved this season."We have the confidence that we can win away from home, we did it last year. To catch Leinster will be tough, they'll have to lose it. We still have two games, we'll add some new bodies. There's some coming back from injury and I'm excited about that and hopefully we hit our straps just in time."21:44 25 AprilGlasgow suffer home defeat by powerful Bulls, published at 21:44 25 AprilGlasgow suffer home defeat by powerful BullsAttributionGlasgowScotland must find their inner 'dog' in vital finale - Wassell published at 12:20 25 April12:20 25 AprilTom EnglishBBC Scotland's chief sports writerImage source, SNSImage caption, Scotland's sole win so far came against Wales in the opening gameEmma Wassell says Scotland have "wrongs to right" in their "vital" final game of the Women's Six Nations against Ireland on Saturday.Having suffered a damaging loss at home to Italy in round three, Bryan Easson's side have only one win from four having targeted three victories this season.They now host an improving Ireland who had a seismic win over New Zealand last year. The Irish have won two from four in a tournament that is  especially important given the World Cup takes place in England in August.Lock Wassell, whose return to rugby is progressing following operations to remove a tumour in her chest last autumn, has called on her team-mates to find their inner-dog against the Irish."You can't really coach bringing out the dog," the 30-year-old told the BBC Scotland Rugby Podcast. "Sometimes you need something that can bring that out and individual players just need to find what it is."This game is vital. Ultimately, you could see us bottom of the table [if results go against them] and that's the honest truth of it."The disappointing and unexpected loss to Italy in Edinburgh was the day Scotland's campaign went off track, Wassell says.She added: "I don't think it was really us out there. It felt quite flat. Why that is, I don't think we're 100% sure. Verbally, no one was complacent, but mentally, have we almost assumed that we would win that game? It's hard to really pinpoint it."Everyone knew it wasn't good enough. I think we have a few wrongs to right. Sometimes before a game it's very easy to go into your shell and I think we need players to express themselves out there."I know the capabilities of this squad. So, yes, fans may be frustrated, but it's really hard and the players feel it more than ever."Will early-season 'wastefulness' cost Edinburgh top-eight finish?published at 12:15 25 April12:15 25 AprilBBC Scotland's chief sportswriter Tom English has been answering some of your Scottish rugby questions.Andrew asked: Edinburgh impressed in the main against a Sharks team that took until the second half to properly find their fins. If we finish outside the top eight, for me it's more down to points dropped earlier in the season. Edinburgh can still finish in the top eight but will they?Tom answered: I agree. They lost an amount of ridiculous points in previous rounds and their predicament now is because of weakness and wastefulness back then.They have a tough away game in Parma to face Zebre on Friday night and they have multiple injuries to boot. Zebre have won five games this season having won one last season and none the season before. This could be very hairy for Edinburgh, but they have to win.Then they have to beat Connacht away and they have Ulster at home in the last round. It's so, so tight and incredibly hard to call as a result.Edinburgh have to win at least two and probably all three to make it. Odds slightly against them, I think. But they're showing improvements in recents weeks, so that would give me some hope if I was an Edinburgh fan.Paul asked: Glasgow, and now Edinburgh too, have pretty awful injury lists at the business end of the season. With reduced squad sizes planned for next term, have the pro teams peaked? Whilst I get the finances, is it going to help grow the game if the height of ambition for Glasgow and Edinburgh is to finish top eight in the URC?Tom answered: I don't think the height of Glasgow's ambition is ever going to be top eight. They're champions and currently second in the table. Yes, they're losing a few but they're gaining a few as well.They'll still have a terrific squad, albeit with giant Tom Jordan and Henco Venter holes in it. Their ambition next year will be to win it.I certainly think there is a whole load of improvement in Edinburgh. They've been underperforming for a long time. Even without Jamie Ritchie next season they should have enough to contend.Merely scraping into the top eight shouldn't be good enough for them. Yes, budgets will be a challenge, but there are not many teams in the competition awash with cash. Leinster are the outliers.08:36 25 AprilWilliamson fronts up as Bulls promise charge, published at 08:36 25 AprilWilliamson fronts up as Bulls promise chargeAttributionGlasgowTigers' Whitcombe & Cardiff's Litterick Edinburgh boundpublished at 16:22 24 April16:22 24 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, James Whitcombe qualifies to play for ScotlandLoosehead prop James Whitcombe will join Edinburgh from Leicester Tigers on a three-year deal this summer, with Cardiff tighthead Rhys Litterick arriving on a two-year contract.Whitcombe, 24, qualifies for Scotland through a grandparent and has made five starts and 11 substitute appearances for Tigers this season.Litterick, 26, can also represent Scotland, as well as Wales, and has featured 18 times this term, seven times from the start."I'm really looking forward to the move up north," said Whitcombe. "It's a fresh opportunity for me – a chance to challenge myself in a new environment, both on and off the pitch."I want to help the club win trophies. That's the goal. I want to contribute to a successful team and be part of something special in the Scottish capital."Litterick commented: "It's a massive opportunity to grow both on and off the pitch in a new environment. Hopefully, I can contribute as much as I can to push for silverware."As a tighthead, I take a lot of pride in my set piece and working hard around the pitch."And head coach Sean Everitt added: "Securing a player of James' quality on a long-term deal is a significant coup for the club."He is a highly-rated young prop with a fantastic pedigree, having come through a strong Leicester Tigers system and gained valuable experience in a very competitive Premiership environment."Rhys has shown impressive consistency in a quality Cardiff side this season and we're delighted to welcome him to Edinburgh."Tighthead is a position where there is often a lot of attrition, so bolstering our options with a prop of Rhys's calibre is crucial for us."Scotland internationals return for Warriorspublished at 15:40 24 April15:40 24 AprilImage source, SNSImage caption, George Horne comes back into the Glasgow line-upGlasgow Warriors welcome back seven Scotland internationals and Patrick Schickerling for Friday's United Rugby Championship meeting with Bulls at Scotstoun.Wing Kyle Rowe, fly-half Tom Jordan and scrum-half George Horne are the backs returning, while back-rows Gregor Brown and Rory Darge, loosehead prop Nathan McBeth and lock Max Williamson are back in the pack, along with tighthead Schickerling.Ollie Smith moves from outside centre to full-back, captain Kyle Steyn moves from the wing to outside centre and McDowall moves from outside to inside centre.

They're a very physical side, they've shown that against some of the top sides in the world, and we have to fight fire with fire this weekend."On the return of Leah Bartlett, Anne Young and Rachel Malcolm: "The three of them give us real opportunities, it was three fairly good conversations around selection, but three good players to come in."Easson says the result won't "be a defining moment" but Scotland "want to make sure that we are learning from all the games."14:25 24 AprilScotland aim to 'finish on high' against Ireland, published at 14:25 24 AprilScotland aim to 'finish on high' against IrelandAttributionScottish Rugby11:26 24 AprilWassell 'has so much to fight for' after tumour scare, published at 11:26 24 AprilWassell 'has so much to fight for' after tumour scareAttributionScotlandRussell a Lions starter? What is Nucifora doing for Scotland?published at 09:25 24 April09:25 24 AprilBBC Scotland's chief sportswriter Tom English has been answering some of your Scottish rugby questions.Graeme asked: Do the Lions need Finn Russell more than he needs the Lions?Tom answered: Er, no. I'd imagine that Russell would be achieving a dream if he was starting 10 for the Lions, as he should be, in my opinion.He doesn't need the Lions but he deserves this tour and his brilliance warrants a Test team spot, assuming his form stays as it is.This whole business with Johnny Sexton has caused a bit of confusion. Given the silly things he has said about Russell, and his obvious issue with him, Sexton should now be picking up the phone and arranging a face-to-face chat with him to clear the air. This is something he absolutely needs to do.Rod asked: David Nucifora arrived with huge expectations, I really thought we needed someone with his background and skills. But so far I have seen nothing in terms of change. And now he is off with the Lions for the summer. Am I missing something - have you heard or seen anything he is doing?Tom answered: Scotland's pathway issues go back many years and there's no way Nucifora was going to come in, wave a magic wand and fix things in a matter of months.This is a serious piece of work that needs doing. It's failure at all levels at underage rugby and the entire pathway department in the SRU needs an overhaul. I'm told Nucifora is working away on that. Don't expect a grand unveiling of the masterplan any time soon.Him going away with the Lions is a very bad look. He shouldn't be going on that tour. He should be with Scotland on their tour, getting to know people, picking some brains.I can completely understand why some are asking about Nucifora and what on earth he's actually doing, given his Lions involvement.But in the area of pathway development he's one of the best in the world, so let's hold fire a while longer to see what he can come up with.He's with the SRU for two years. Personally, I think he's going to need every day of those two years to try to fix the shambles of Scotland's pathway system.Nick asked: How concerning it is to see Scotland U18s lose comprehensively to Spain?Tom answered: It's the continuation of what we've been saying at underage. It's very, very concerning. They lost all three of their games. It's why David Nucifora has been brought in, See above answer for more on that. I think the SRU have got the best pathway planner in Nucifora, but it's going to take time.Scotland lock Craig joins Glasgowpublished at 13:31 23 April13:31 23 AprilImage source, SNSGlasgow Warriors have signed Scotland lock Alex Craig for next season.Craig, 27, has played with Scarlets for the last two campaigns and made 40 appearances having previously spent over four years with Gloucester.He was voted as Scarlets' player of the season last year by his team-mates.From Castle Douglas, Craig made the last of his six Scotland caps as a replacement in the win over Australia at Murrayfield in November last year."For me, coming back home is a massive opportunity and I'm looking forward to getting stuck in," Craig told Glasgow's website."I'm from Castle Douglas, and I've always kept a close eye on how Glasgow were doing as I supported the club when growing up. To see the club go from strength to strength in recent seasons has been so impressive, and they just keep getting better and better as a team."I know quite a lot of the boys from U20s and from Scotland duty; I grew up playing minis with Stafford [McDowall] too, his dad was my first rugby coach and we played together from when we were seven until about 14 or 15. "Stafford's probably the one I spoke to the most when making the decision to move up here, but everyone I've spoken to has had nothing but good things to say about the club."Listen: BBC Scotland Rugby Podcastpublished at 13:28 23 April13:28 23 AprilJoining Tom English on this week's episode of the BBC Scotland Rugby Podcast are Glasgow lock Max Williamson and Scotland lock Emma Wassell, who shares a health update after a tumour was discovered in her chest last autumn.Listen and subscribe on BBC SoundsMcKay signs new three-year deal at Glasgowpublished at 16:15 22 April16:15 22 AprilImage source, SNSJosh McKay says it was an "easy decision" to sign a contract extension keeping him at Glasgow Warriors until summer 2028.The New Zealand-born full-back, 27, has scored 17 tries in 62 appearances since joining in November 2021.McKay, who will be eligible for Scotland through the residency rule in autumn next year, said: "It was a really easy decision to renew in the end."It's great to have a good bit of certainty on where I'll be for the next few years – I love it here, both playing for Glasgow but also living in the city and being able to get out and explore Scotland."To be able to do all of that for the next three years is huge, and I can't wait to make more memories with the boys."I'd love to play 100 games for this club and I'd love to win more silverware with the boys. We've got a really good group here and we know that we've got a great chance to do just that over the next few years."Head coach Franco Smith says McKay has "fully bought into" what the current URC champions are trying to build, adding: "His performances are consistently of the highest level, as well as developing into a leader on and off the field."previous pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageFind us hereInstagramTikTokFacebookXYouTubeHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
