Cardiff were last relegated from the second tier of English football in 1985Dafydd PritchardBBC Sport Wales at Cardiff City StadiumCardiff City will play in the third tier of English football for the first time in 22 years next season after their relegation from the Championship was confirmed with a goalless draw against West Bromwich Albion on a day of despair in the Welsh capital.Although hopes of survival were already hanging by a thread following Luton Town's win over Coventry City earlier on Saturday, Cardiff were backed by a passionately believing home crowd and played with the determination of a team that thought they could pull off an almighty escape act.They were fortunate not to fall behind during a first half in which the Baggies missed several chances as Ethan Horvath was kept busy in the Bluebirds' goal and Isaac Price hit a post.Cardiff had opportunities of their own either side of the interval and, after an hour, it was only a combination of West Brom goalkeeper Josh Griffiths and the woodwork which kept Alex Robertson and Yousef Salech at bay in a frenzied few seconds.That flurry of activity raised hopes of Cardiff snatching the win that would have kept intact their paper-thin aspirations of staying up, but the draw consigned them to the bottom of the table and the relegation that had felt inevitable for some time.West Brom, who were playing their first game under interim manager James Morrison following the departure of Tony Mowbray, needed victory to keep alive their faint hopes of making the play-offs, but this result means they will be in the Championship again next season.Ramsey 'gutted' but backs Cardiff for instant returnPublished1 day agoThere was a sense that the damage had already been done to Cardiff's faltering bid to avoid relegation, with a run of just one win from their previous 13 matches leading to their second managerial sacking of the season as Omer Riza was dismissed a week earlier.Wales captain Aaron Ramsey was brought in as caretaker boss with three games left, a desperate roll of the dice from the club's much-maligned owner Vincent Tan.And while Ramsey is blameless for the Bluebirds' demise, there was already an acceptance from most supporters that relegation was inevitable after they drew at home against Oxford United in his first game in charge on Easter Monday.Luton's last-gasp win over Coventry in one of Saturday's earlier games was another nail in the coffin for Cardiff's rapidly fading hopes of staying up.Where Ramsey, his players and the fans were concerned, though, all was not lost quite yet.Buoyed by an encouraging home crowd, Cardiff were close to taking an early lead when Calum Chambers' header was cleared off the line by Price.West Brom dominated from that point and missed several chances, with Price and Callum Styles both drawing fine saves from Horvath before Price hit the post from Adam Armstrong's cutback.Cardiff thought they had scored against the run of play when Chambers headed in from David Turnbull's free-kick, but the former Arsenal defender was flagged offside.Chances flowed at both ends in the second half, and the hosts came agonisingly close to a precious lead when Robertson had one shot blocked, another saved and Salech fired against the post before Chambers was denied by Griffiths.West Brom almost killed their opponents off completely with chances for Karlan Grant and Armstrong, but still Cardiff hung on and threatened through substitutes Ollie Tanner and Joe Ralls.At the final whistle, the home fans chanted "City till I die" and applauded their players, but turned their ire on owner Tan once more, calling on him to leave.That has been a common refrain in recent years but, despite the supporters' fury which has manifest itself with demonstrations and protests as well as anger at games, Cardiff remain financially dependent on their Malaysian backer.Having narrowly escaped relegation in two of the previous three seasons, Cardiff have become embroiled in one crisis too many. This relegation had been coming.'Gutted' but still 'proud' - post-match reaction:Cardiff caretaker manager Aaron Ramsey:"I'm gutted. I'm a fan as well. I'm sad to see this club going down. The fans have had a difficult time this season and I really feel for them. I know how they're feeling."But also I want to say I'm proud of the last couple of performances. The level of effort the players have put in and the information they've taken on was evident."We could have won on other days but the reality is we haven't been good enough over the course of the season and we have to accept that."West Brom caretaker manager James Morrison:"I was pleased with the backline who defended well and put their bodies on the line."But I'm frustrated with that last bit. Feels that's the story of our season."I asked them to take that anger and frustration of the week into the game and I could sense that."Related topicsCardiff CityWest Bromwich AlbionChampionshipFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 641Championship Scores & FixturesSaturday 26th AprilLuton Town 1 , Coventry City 0 at Full timeLutonLuton TownLuton Town10CoventryCoventry CityCoventry CityFull timeFTQueens Park Rangers 0 , Burnley 5 at Full timeQPRQueens Park RangersQueens Park Rangers05BurnleyBurnleyBurnleyFull timeFTBlackburn Rovers 2 , Watford 1 at Full timeBlackburnBlackburn RoversBlackburn Rovers21WatfordWatfordWatfordFull timeFTCardiff City 0 , West Bromwich Albion 0 at Full timeCardiffCardiff CityCardiff City00West BromWest Bromwich AlbionWest Bromwich AlbionFull timeFTHull City 0 , Derby County 1 at Full timeHullHull CityHull City01DerbyDerby CountyDerby CountyFull timeFTMiddlesbrough 0 , Norwich City 0 at Full timeMiddlesbroughMiddlesbroughMiddlesbrough00NorwichNorwich CityNorwich CityFull timeFTMillwall 1 , Swansea City 0 at Full timeMillwallMillwallMillwall10SwanseaSwansea CitySwansea CityFull timeFTOxford United 2 , Sunderland 0 at Full timeOxfordOxford UnitedOxford United20SunderlandSunderlandSunderlandFull timeFTPreston North End 1 , Plymouth Argyle 2 at Full timePrestonPreston North EndPreston North End12PlymouthPlymouth ArgylePlymouth ArgyleFull timeFTSheffield Wednesday 1 , Portsmouth 1 at Full timeSheff WedSheffield WednesdaySheffield Wednesday11PortsmouthPortsmouthPortsmouthFull timeFTView all Championship fixturesChampionship TableOn Saturday 26th AprilSkip to table keyMatch Participants:West Bromwich Albion, Position 10, Points 61Cardiff City, Position 24, Points 44TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Burnley452716266155197WResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Leeds United442713489296094DResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win3Sheffield United452871062352789LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win4Sunderland4521131158431576WResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss5Bristol City441716115749867LResult LossWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss6Coventry City45199176258466LResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss7Millwall451812154646066WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win8Blackburn Rovers45198185247565LResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win9Middlesbrough4518101764541064WResult WinLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw10West Bromwich Albion451419125244861LResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw11Swansea City45179194853-560WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss12Sheffield Wednesday451512185968-957LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult Draw13Watford45168215260-856LResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss14Norwich City451315176766154LResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw15Queens Park Rangers451314185263-1153DResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss16Portsmouth451411205770-1353LResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinDResult Draw17Oxford United451313194662-1652WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult Win18Stoke City451214194562-1750DResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss19Derby County451310224856-849LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win20Preston North End451019164657-1149DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss21Luton Town451310224264-2249DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win22Hull City451212214353-1048WResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss23Plymouth Argyle451113215086-3646WResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win24Cardiff City45917194669-2344DResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawView latest Championship tableKeyPosition 1 - 2 : PromotionPosition 3 - 6 : Promotion Play-offPosition 22 - 24 : RelegationSheffield United have been deducted two points for defaulted transfer payments.Last Updated 26th April 2025 at 17:01Please Note: All times UK.
