Send us your thoughtspublished at 12:3612:36Image source, Getty ImagesIpswich Town's future for football next season has now been confirmed.Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Newcastle means the Tractor Boys will be returning straight back to the Championship after their first Premier League campaign in over 20 years.Kieran McKenna's side are currently on course to finish highest of those relegated teams, so perhaps there is a smidgen of positivity to take from that.But why is it they have not been able to survive this season?Is it recruitment? Tactics? Or has the step up just been too big?Let us know - and we'll publish a selection later on Monday12:28Ipswich Town Women exhilarated after promotion, published at 12:28Ipswich Town Women exhilarated after promotionAttributionSuffolkNewcastle 3-0 Ipswich Town - the fans' verdictpublished at 09:2509:25Image source, Getty ImagesWe asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Newcastle United and Ipswich Town.Here are some of your replies:Newcastle fansSimon: Another solid performance, bouncing back from last week's Villa game. A good team performance. Kieran Trippier is having a great spell of form and I'm pleased for Dan Burn and Will Osula in particular. Our final position is in our hands, but we are going to need top performances. Very happy with the way we are playing as a strong team.David: I know we weren't firing on all cylinders but we still got the job done comfortably. Remember the days when, at this time of the season, we would be so pleased to reach the 40-point mark?Steve: Great to see Osula finally get some game time. He is a player with a bright future.Ozzy: Great to see Eddie Howe back, but you can tell by looking at him that he's not 100% yet. We got better as the match went on and we should have scored a few more goals. VAR was certainly wrong to disallow Bruno Guimaraes' goal in the first half, as the goalkeeper simply misjudged the flight of the ball and fell over. If we get points away to Brighton and Arsenal, then win both of our home games against Chelsea and Everton, it should be enough to qualify for Champions League. Everyone on Tyneside will be keeping everything crossed for the next few weeks.Ipswich fansRobert: Well the party is over and we are off to the Championship. Once again, a very lacklustre performance. We went down with a whimper and not with a roar.  The stats say it all - Newcastle had 22 shots and Ipswich only had four. A very disappointing season, but what a wonder run with two promotions. The main worry I have for an immediate return to the Premier League is whether we will be able to keep our manager and buy players who can compete at the top level.Dave: Kieran McKenna - lucky to go up, deserved to go down and, in my opinion, paid too much to get sacked.Tim: What was Ben Johnson thinking when he committed a blatant foul for his second yellow? That killed the game for us. Our defence did well to keep the score down. I'm going to miss Liam Delap if he does leave - he was a handful for Newcastle with the few scraps he received.Kevin: The game was quite good. Obviously, Newcastle had more possession, but Town had a few chances on the break. Everything changed after the sending off. Then it was down to the spirit of the players to basically keep the score reasonable against a free-scoring team. Yet again marvellous support from the Tractor Boys. We go again next season.Bill: Pathetic performances over the season. They were bang average at best and over-hyped.Ipswich 'best placed' to bounce straight back uppublished at 08:1108:11John BennettFinal Score reporter at St James’ ParkImage source, Getty ImagesAt the full-time whistle, I made sure I looked straight up to the Ipswich fans to see their reaction to the confirmation that the club were heading back to the Championship.It was no surprise to see them all on their feet applauding the players.Kieran McKenna was not surprised either. He told me after the Newcastle game that the supporters have always appreciated this incredible journey they have been on together from League One to the Premier League. Now it is back to the Championship but, looking at this squad and their unity, they are, in my opinion, the best placed of all the three relegated teams to bounce straight back. Especially if they can keep McKenna at the club.At one of the other relegated clubs, Leicester, there is a real disconnect right now between fans and players. That could not be much further from the situation at Ipswich.It is something that will be a massive positive going into a crucial summer and the start of next season.Gossip: Man Utd make Delap contingency planspublished at 08:0108:01Manchester United remain interested in signing Crystal Palace's French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, 27, if they are unable to win the race for Ipswich Town's Liam Delap.

We knew it was pretty likely and we had conversations inside to focus on each game as they come. We know there is a time for reflection so today the mathematical completion doesn't change too much. We have been through the emotions."On the supporters: "They have been fantastic, they have been on the journey with us. It has been an incredible journey - from the middle of League One to competing in the Premier League in an unprecedented way."They have seen the group has given everything and competed in so many games. At the end, we have fallen short but it's not for lack of effort. They have been fantastic and we really appreciate the support."On the red card: "We managed the game well. It has been a very difficult week in terms of availability and getting a team out there. We managed the game really well, we were solid, we were frustrating the opponent. The game was right where we wanted it to be."We were frustrated with the first yellow card and then it changes the game - 11 v 10 with the crowd they have here is almost an impossible task."Ben [Johnson] is running at the last man. Dan Burn sticks his leg and knee out and there is probably minimum contact, but there is contact there. If you are running at that speed, you don't have to get smacked by it and you can go over on the contact. I don't think Ben has taken a dive in his life."On red cards being costly this season: "They have been. That's five red cards. I think we had one in my two and half years before this season. To have five this season is a reflection of a lot of things."Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich: Tractor Boys' fate sealed after Johnson's costly dismissalpublished at 17:56 26 April17:56 26 AprilMatthew HowarthBBC Sport journalistImage source, Getty ImagesThe writing has been on the wall for quite some time for Ipswich Town.Manager Kieran McKenna admitted relegation was likely after watching his team lose 2-1 at home to Wolves earlier in April, a defeat which left them 12 points adrift of safety with seven matches remaining.Saturday's reverse at St James' Park sealed the Tractor Boys' fate with four games left, but the visitors matched Newcastle for long spells of the first half and restricted the Magpies to very few clear-cut openings.However, Ben Johnson's 37th-minute red card - just seven minutes after he was booked for diving under Dan Burn's challenge - swung what had been an uneventful contest in Newcastle's favour.The wideman is the fifth Ipswich player to be given his marching orders this season - only Arsenal have been shown more red cards in the 2024-25 season.Alexander Isak's penalty in first-half stoppage time broke the visitors' crumbling resistance before efforts from Burn and Will Osula clinched a comfortable win for the Magpies.This is the first time in Premier League history that all relegations have been confirmed with as many as four games remaining.Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich Town: Key statspublished at 17:46 26 April17:46 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesOnly Southampton (2) have gained fewer points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than Ipswich Town (3).Ben Johnson received his first Premier League red card in what was his 91st appearance in the competition. It was Ipswich's fifth red card this season, the joint-most of any team alongside Arsenal.17:39 26 AprilIpswich already looking to the future after relegation.

I think we have probably let ourselves down one too many times. I'm disappointed and gutted the dream is over, but I think there is a pride and determination that we want to be back here in 14 months."On Ben Johnson's red card and the penalty: "I'm not sure the first one is a yellow, but the second one definitely is - so once he has got a yellow card, the referee has to do that. The penalty is what it is."On Kieran McKenna's message at full-time: "We went over to the away end at the end and it is full. They have been brilliant. We want to come back here and give a better account of ourselves in 14 months and go toe-to-toe with Newcastle."Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich Town - send us your thoughtspublished at 17:01 26 April17:01 26 AprilWere you at St. James' Park or following from elsewhere?Have your say on Newcastle's performanceWhat did you make of Ipswich's display?Come back to this page on Monday to find a selection of your replies16:58 26 AprilIpswich relegated as Newcastle beat them to go third, published at 16:58 26 AprilIpswich relegated as Newcastle beat them to go thirdAttributionPremier LeagueComments69414:21 26 AprilPremier League promotion part of writing festival , published at 14:21 26 AprilPremier League promotion part of writing festival AttributionSuffolkFollow Saturday's Premier League games livepublished at 11:39 26 April11:39 26 AprilFive matches make up Saturday's Premier League action and BBC Sport will bring you every kick.Chelsea v Everton (12:30)Brighton v West HamNewcastle v Ipswich - BBC Radio 5 Live commentarySouthampton v Fulham Wolves v Leicester All kick-off times 15:00 BST unless statedFollow all of the action and reaction hereSutton's predictions: Newcastle v Ipswich Townpublished at 11:16 26 April11:16 26 AprilIt's great news that Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will be back in the dug-out for this game after his stay in hospital.I don't see his side having any trouble securing the three points here, based on what I saw from Ipswich against Arsenal last week.

It is my full 100 per cent focus."Newcastle United v Ipswich Town: Did you know?published at 09:54 25 April09:54 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesIf Ipswich fail to win (or West Ham avoid defeat at Brighton), their relegation back to the Championship will be confirmed. It would be the first time in Premier League history that all relegations are confirmed with as many as four games to go, and the second time all three have happened before May after 2005-06.'A completely dismantled team'published at 09:01 25 April09:01 25 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesIpswich captain Sam Morsy speaks about the importance of maintaining perspective and motivation despite recent setbacks as they go into Saturday's game against Newcastle United: "You always have high expectations of yourself and the team, and when you fall below that, it can become challenging, but at the same time, it's good to always keep the perspective if there's still games to play and try and compete and do as best as you can."We're going to Newcastle and will try and get something."If you give up in these moments, you never get a chance to see the good moments again. So it's going to be a good one, but it's going to be tough one."Our three right wingers are all out for the season and injuries everywhere. We're going to need each other. We're going to one of the toughest places in the league with a completely dismantled team."For us, it's about expanding, getting better, strengthening the squad in every window, international scouting, all these things. It's part of the process of growing so then you can reach the goal - which is to be a sustainable Premier League club."Gossip: Newcastle interested in Delappublished at 07:53 25 April07:53 25 AprilNewcastle are interested in activating the £30m release clause in the contract of Ipswich and England Under-21 striker Liam Delap, 22, which will become active if the Tractor Boys are relegated from the Premier League.

Read Friday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC SportMcKenna on availability, Delap's future and using the academypublished at 16:57 24 April16:57 24 AprilIpswich Town boss Kieran McKenna has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Newcastle United (kick-off 15:00).Here are the key lines from his news conference:McKenna began by putting worries of demotivation amidst relegation possibilites aside: "It isn't very hard to get the group focused. We have got a small group at the moment in terms of availability, so everyone out on the training pitch knows that they're going to be needed. Motivation isn't the problem."He then spoke about the challenges of being a promoted team trying to stay in the Premier League: "I think the gap [between the Championship and Premier League], from a financial point of view, is getting bigger, and it's been getting more of a challenge for clubs to be able to bridge that."On Ipswich dropping 27 points from winning positions this season: "It's a reflection of a lot of positive work. The fact that we haven't held onto enough of those results is a big disappointment that isn't helped by a lack of experience that comes with being a promoted team."McKenna on finalising the team selection for the Newcastle United match: "We are in a challenging spot in terms of availability. We are working really hard to get a team together that can go there and be as competitive as we can be. There will be young players involved from the academy at the weekend and possibly in the next few weeks, and that is good experience for them."On the availability on Liam Delap and Conor Chaplin: "Conor is not fit, so he's unavailable. A decision is to be made about Delap. He's better again this week, so we'll see what's appropriate."He then praises Eddie Howe's side: "They've got a fantastic squad. They've really built a top team for the Premier League. Their physicality, athleticism is on an outstanding level, and that's before you take in the technical quality that they have as well."McKenna says he won't rule out the possibility of Liam Delap staying at Ipswich despite interest from bigger clubs: "Liam's focus is still here, and finishing the season as strong as what it will be. I think there's certainly a possibility that he's an Ipswich player next year."Gossip: Man Utd plan to trigger Delap release clausepublished at 07:36 23 April07:36 23 AprilManchester United plan to trigger the £30m release clause in the contract of Ipswich's 22-year-old English striker Liam Delap.

Read Wednesday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC Sport'The misery dividend' - why yo-yo clubs will continuepublished at 12:37 22 April12:37 22 AprilRichard WoodwardFan writerImage source, Getty ImagesI have nothing constructive to add into the discourse following Ipswich's Easter Sunday defeat by Arsenal. On a lovely sunny Suffolk afternoon, Leif Davis is now public enemy number one for those of a red persuasion, Town shipped another four goals at Portman Road, and ultimately nothing new was learned. Bring on the summer please.Something I found more egregious to discuss was the contents of a tweet posted by football finance expert Kieran Maguire, external on social media on Monday.Maguire explained that when Leicester and Southampton were relegated in 2022-23 and promoted back the following season, £102m in parachute payments were saved. He added that Burnley and Leeds' promotion back to the top flight will save a further £51m.These "savings", and hopefully you can see this coming, do not get pumped into charitable causes (at least directly), nor do they help level the playing field to the rest of the pyramid or bolster the grassroots game. No, these savings are split between Premier League clubs like some kind of misery dividend.And while the gathering debate among football pundits about the increasing anti-competitive disparity between the Premier League and EFL is helpful (if not somewhat belated), it seems to be just talk while those with the power to act – the Premier League and the member clubs - do nothing, or worse are incentivised to maintain it.That Premier League clubs benefit from certain clubs yo-yoing up and down like some kind of horrible purgatory (something I fear for my team Ipswich) and it is this group that have the influence to make change.What chance does the wider game have? After all, turkeys don't vote for Christmas (nor eggs for Easter etc.).Find more from Richard Woodward at the Blue Monday Podcast, externalprevious pagePage 1 of 42123456…42next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
