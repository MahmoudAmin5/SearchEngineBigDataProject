The fitness levels between the two teams were clear to see. There are happy people in Wolverhampton at last. Matheus Cunha was the standout - he just wants to please the fans! I hope he stays.Steve: Cunha is going to be jumping off a ship sailing to much better times and joining the Titanic.Cordelia: Thank you Vitor Pereira for coming to Wolves and giving our players the confidence to play and show off their skills. We always knew they were quality but now everyone can see it. Leicester fans - good luck next season.Kieran: What a run. We need to buy Vitor lots of pints - what a turnaround! If we back this man in the summer, just think of what we could do.Espirito: People are praising this team like they have beaten a team at the top of the table, but we have not. We should be beating teams like this to little fanfare and it just shows how far the club has fallen. We don't need nor want Cunha. Let another team deal with his attitude. The same goes for Jose Sa and Toti, otherwise we will be in this position again.Leicester fansChris: We are 'using these games to prepare for next season' according to Ruud van Nistelrooy. So obviously picking loan player Facundo Buonanotte who definitely won't be with us next season and giving Jamie Vardy another 90 minutes when we know he is leaving makes perfect sense, right? The whole club is a joke. As for the performance, I don't think the players could have put less effort in if they tried. But not trying is a bit of a theme.Nathan: Is this the worst and most unlikable Premier League team ever? Yes. A record-breakingly bad manager, a board that seems not to care, and players who seemingly cannot play the game. Can we just forfeit the remaining games because we will lose them all by at least three goals and will be unable to score?Tom: One word: awful. From top to bottom, it's toxic. We need new owners, management, coaches and players. It is going to be a long few seasons with hard times and hard work to get the club stable at the least.Christy: A club in all sorts of trouble. The manager appears to be clueless, the players nowhere near the standard required, the coaching staff do not seem to understand this standard and the people who run the club make far too many errors. They should really think about putting Leicester City up for sale.Gossip: Cunha offered five-year deal at Man Utdpublished at 07:3507:35Manchester United have offered Wolves forward Matheus Cunha a five-year contract if the 25-year-old Brazilian opts to move to Old Trafford.

I don't have this crystal ball. I cannot say that he will leave. He is with us - committed with us - and we are happy with him."He has a high quality game, he is a special player. He is committed, with his teammates, to help the club do the best we can until the end of the season."Wolves recorded their sixth straight Premier League win, their best run in the top flight since 1970, after Cunha fired them ahead in the first half before Strand Larsen drilled in from his pass.Jose Sa then saved a Jamie Vardy penalty before Rodrigo Gomes latched onto another Cunha pass to make it 3-0 late on. "Happiness," said Pereira, when asked how he felt with six-in-a-row. "It is everything I can ask because the energy is good in the stadium, between the supporters and the team, between the players, the staff and the supporters."This is what we can do in football."Pereira also admitted he might go into Wolverhampton for a drink to celebrate with the supporters, having been seen going to the local Wetherspoons after recent victories. "Maybe - because I didn't lose a lot of energy today!" he said. "I was OK. I lose energy when I don't like the team playing in the way that I am seeing."'Sometimes I lose my focus in the game because I want to thank the fans'published at 18:57 26 April18:57 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWolves manager Vitor Pereira has been speaking to BBC Match of the Day about the win: "I'm very proud of my team and our supporters. Happiness and good football - I'm happy. I like good football. I don't like to win a game without playing good football with our identity."We can create our identity but first of all, when we arrived, it was about defending better and now I want more. I want the team playing football with the ball. Since the first day, I said to them: 'I came here because you have quality. If not, I wouldn't have taken the job. I have a clear idea about football and you must be open to start playing to create our identity'."Since the first day, I felt the players understood the things we want from them. It is not just about tactics, it is about energy also. We are very happy in this moment."On Matheus Cunha: "He is a special player. When he feels the happiness inside, when he is himself, he can create. He played a fantastic game. It shows he is committed with us, with his teammates, with everyone."On fans chanting his name: "It is difficult to imagine. Sometimes I lose my focus in the game because I want to thank the fans. This is the connection since the first game - it is something special that I didn't expect. I had it at other clubs, but it was not like this."On his expectations: "We need to finish this season in the best position we can and show our spirit, identity and ambition. We have the ambition to win the next game."With full spirit, wanting to help each other and confidence, we can just think about the next game. Now it is time to recover and enjoy it a bit."'I've never been that embarrassed and then that happy in such a short time'published at 18:51 26 April18:51 26 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen has been speaking to BBC Match of the Day after scoring to help secure the club's Premier League future: "Incredible feeling - six games in a row. That's something we never expected early in the season. It shows hard work and courage - everything you need to get back into the game after a tough start to the season."The new staff came in with great energy. The players are the same, so maybe sometimes you need a change. We played a few good games also with Gary [O'Neil] and they are great people. It's not about the change but, of course, when you get a new manager then everyone wants to show themselves."We put a lot of work in during training. At the beginning, it was up and down [with Vitor Pereira] but now it is where it should be. I'm really happy for the guys because we struggled at the beginning of the season."On playing with Matheus Cunha: "It's very easy, especially on the ball. He has that freedom to go where he wants to go and we just fill in the space. He is finding the space himself and he is an amazing player, especially for a striker who wants to score."On his miss just before his goal: "I've never been that embarrassed and then that happy in such a short time."I should have got another one in the first half and, obviously, in the second half. I'm glad I had Matheus to celebrate the goal with. Misses happen in football, I'm a striker and it happens. It's just a millimetre and it will go in."It caught me off guard a little bit and I need to give Rayan [Ait-Nouri] an apology for not getting him an assist. For me, I just needed a moment to get back into the game and a few moments later I was able to score."On continuing the winning run: "We don't expect to go and win every game. We know that if we continue to play as we did in the last games, we can beat anyone at the moment."18:25 26 AprilI don't like to win a game without playing good football - Pereira.

Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Hwang Hee-chan are also likely be involved after missing last weekend's trip to Manchester. Wolves are eyeing a sixth straight Premier League win as they face Leicester but Pereira said he is "not a guy to look for records" and added that the most important thing is for the players to "compete for the three points again."The Wolves boss said 17-year-old Mateus Mane "has the talent to be a big part of the future of the club". More on forward Mane, who was on the bench for Wolves' past two games: "I want to give him the minutes he deserve but haven't found the right opportunity to do so. I can't predict the future with a crystal ball but I believe he will be one of the figures in the Premier League." Pereira said his first game in charge of Wolves - a 3-0 win at Leicester last December - is one that he will remember for life. On already-relegated Leicester, he said that Ruud van Nistelrooy's side have quality and that "they will come to prove themselves".The Portuguese manager also hailed Jamie Vardy as "one of the best strikers in the Premier League" after his decision to leave the Foxes at the end of the season. He added on Vardy: "He has had a fantastic career. A beautiful career. He's someone I respect a lot. He is a very intelligent player - someone who knows how to play in the limit of offside."

Read Thursday's full gossip columnFollow the gossip column on BBC SportIn-form Wolves '100% could do better'published at 16:05 23 April16:05 23 AprilMike TaylorBBC Radio WM reporterImage source, Getty Images"I don't think we were good, I don't think we played overly well," said Dan Bentley. "By our own standards, we're not delighted with the performance, and we weren't at our fluid best. But we showed a steeliness."We were standing on the same spot as almost exactly two years previously, after Bentley had made his first Premier League appearance at Old Trafford. Before Sunday, he had started only four more league games since and then, 20 minutes before kick-off, Jose Sa seemed to feel something go in his back.After signing, Bentley was always likely to be the number two to Sa but the unexpected signing of Sam Johnstone last summer pushed him back down the queue. His efficient display on Sunday reflected well on how diligently he has worked in the background."I've been in a position I don't specifically like, in terms of number three," he said.  "Obviously I want to be challenging to play and putting pressure on whoever's playing. "But I am a firm believer that things happen for a reason, and this was one of those days where I end up on the pitch, keeping a clean sheet and getting three points at Old Trafford, which is something I'll savour."He has at least had a ringside seat to study how Wolves' season has been repaired.  "A huge part of it is mentality," he explained. "When our mentality is right, we give ourselves the best chance. Maybe it was the position that we were in, where we were teetering above the relegation zone, and maybe there was a realisation of 'actually, this is serious'."I don't want to say we were in a false position, because we were in that position for a reason, and our performances up to that point put us there. But we've all had to dig in and show our quality to stay in the Premier League, because it's an unforgiving league."Part of that mentality, in Bentley's account, is to not be satisfied even after winning a fifth successive game. "100% we can do better," he said. "I'm sure if the gaffer came back here now he'd tell you that he's probably disappointed with the performance. It does show the mentality.  "A lot of that is instilled from him. He demands that from us, and we now demand it from each other, so it's a good place to be."Listen to full commentary of Wolves v Leicester at 15:00 on Saturday on on BBC Radio WM (DAB Black Country)Tune into The West Midlands Football Phone-In from 18:00 on weeknights'Would be a real shame' but Wolves 'will be just fine'published at 13:46 23 April13:46 23 AprilImage source, Getty ImagesWe asked you whether Matheus Cunha would be missed at Wolves.This is what you said:Nick: Cunha is a brilliant player and under Gary O'Neil, he saved Wolves' season. Now Pereira has Wolves playing as they should, Cunha is not Wolves' only goalscorer. I don't understand why many are painting Cunha leaving to be a disaster for Wolves.David: Cunha is a very good player, although temperament is suspect. No-one is bigger than the club, so if Cunha wants to go, good luck to him. I think though, like countless others, he'll come to realise that playing every week and being adored by the fans is preferable for your career than being an occasional starter on big wages. As for joining Man Utd, I can't see why he'd take a sideways step to a toxic club - unless it's all about the money.Steve: Wolves without Cunha is definitely an improvement. Very gifted player no doubt but seriously flawed. Sulks and does not perform for the team. He wants to play for us, gets new contract and then within a couple of games talking about leaving. Disciplinary wise he is a nightmare and a poor example to youngsters. Take the money and run and bring in a couple of committed players that work for the team.Not a Wolves fan? Find and follow your club hereDarron: It's a real shame Matheus wants to leave, as I think we're on the verge of getting back into a possible top 10 or even higher finish next season. Vitor Pereira has a nucleus of players to build around, which could have included him. I thought he would possibly stick around, taking note of players like Ruben Neves, Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota, who stuck with us when we got promoted to the Premier League and brought Europa League football to the Molineux for two successive seasons.Matt: Cunha can go. He's a top-class player and dare I say it's time for him to move on. The issue I have with our owners is how they will spend the money. Someone has got to score the goals when Cunha goes. Have Wolves got the network to find a diamond in the rough? I just hope we don't waste the money.Birchy: Wolves have done well enough with Cunha for the games injured and suspended. As long as the money is re-invested properly, I think we will be just fine.Would Wolves miss Cunha?published at 10:57 23 April10:57 23 AprilNicola PearsonBBC Sport journalistNews of your star player's possible summer exit breaking just as you have secured your Premier League status for another season is not ideal as as a fan.But that is the reality for Wolves supporters after it emerged on Tuesday that Manchester United are interested in signing forward Matheus Cunha.With 16 goals and four assists across all competitions this campaign, the 25 year old's numbers have been impressive.But how worried do fans need to be about the possibility of life without Cunha?Maybe not as concerned as they once could have been.While the sample size of matches without the Brazil international in the side is much smaller (13 as opposed 62), according to Opta, Wolves do boast a better win percentage across all competitions over the past two seasons when he has not played - 61.5% without Cunha against 29% with.With 91 goals scored in games he has featured and 18 netted when has not, the average number of goals for is remarkably similar (1.5 with vs 1.4 without).The team also tend to concede less when he has not been on the pitch, averaging 1.9 with him and 1.2 without.When looking at the Premier League alone over the past two seasons, while again a similar difference in sample size, Wolves have picked up more points without the forward in the team - taking 1.1 points per game when Cunha does play, compared to 1.7 when he does not.With 12 goals and three assists in 34 games this campaign, a key factor has been striker Jorgen Strand Larsen stepping up in Cunha's absence.While no team ever wants to lose their top scorer, perhaps it is possible for Wolves to breathe a little easier if they ultimately have to say goodbye to Cunha this summer.Not a Wolves fan?

Do you think their current form bodes well for next season? Do you think Wolves look better without Matheus Cunha and do you think he is showing he lacks the mentals by claiming he wants to win titles while looking likely to join a mess that is Manchester United? Phil replied: Hello, Nick. Having seen a bit of Wolves recently, I do think their form bodes well for next season. Vitor Pereira has done a top-class job but it is now about recruitment in the summer. There are some really talented players there to build on.I think Wolves would miss a player of Cunha's class but they will get a fee of £62.5m if he goes, so then it will give them a chance to work smartly in the markets.There has been a lot of noise around Cunha and I expect him to go.Whether he ends up at Old Trafford remains to be seen but, strange as it might sound after this season, Manchester United will always hold a special appeal for players.How would Wolves fare without Cunha?Could they be better off?Let us know your thoughtsprevious pagePage 1 of 41123456…41next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
