England coach Mitchell on 'nervy' Grand Slam winResilient England finally get test they neededPublished1 day ago'We got it done' - relieved England clinch Grand Slam after beating France by one pointRed Roses reeled in after fast startLast year in Bordeaux, England recorded a clinical 42-21 victory to clinch yet another Grand Slam, with Holly Aitchison controlling things from fly-half.Saracens fly-half Harrison has edged out Aitchison for selection in this campaign because of her tactical kicking game, and that aspect of her game was illustrated in the opening score as her perfectly weighted grubber kick set up Dow.France came into the fixture undefeated but did suffer a scare in Italy last Saturday, when they were down at half-time and needed a second-half response to keep alive their Grand Slam hopes.Neat offloading got the visitors in behind England's defence and the ball soon found its way to Arbez, who danced over for what looked to be a statement score.However, much of the opening period followed the events of the first half in Parma last week, as Sing went over for the first of her two straightforward finishes.Wing MacDonald added to her two tries in a player-of-the-match performance over Scotland last Saturday, with another sharp finish that followed tries by Atkin-Davies and Sing.With the Red Roses in complete control of the game, Harrison - after a low pass from Natasha Hunt - made the same mistake she did in Cardiff by dropping the ball on her own tryline and that was punished by Bourdon to give hope to France, who were down to 14 players with Assia Khalfaoui in the sin bin.When the prop returned from her punishment for a high tackle, France ended the half the stronger as Menager finished off some slick hands to close the gap to 10 points.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, England captain Aldcroft 'so proud' of Grand Slam winnersClassy France set up grandstand finishThe last time France travelled to Twickenham in 2023 they scored a remarkable 33 second-half points to almost produce a miracle comeback and snatch the Grand Slam.England made sure they started the second period quickly to prevent a repeat, Harrison showing off her running game to dummy and get in behind France's defence and set up Aldcroft.France, however, refused to go away. Arbey fended off Sing and Dow to race clear for a magical score and continue another high-scoring thriller in Twickenham.Harrison continued her impressive response to the unexpected first-half fumble by supplying a long floated pass for Dow's second.Unstructured rugby is when Les Bleues tend to be at their best and once things opened up Bourgeois and Grisez grabbed scores to help set up a grandstand finish, with those scores ensuring France surpassed their record from 2023 of points (33) scored against England.The clock was in the red as Harrison restarted the game and as Mitchell's side walked to halfway the home crowd erupted in a show of support.A second eruption followed as France spilled the ball to conclude a pulsating finish.If both sides top their World Cup pool and win their quarter-finals they will meet in the final four of this year's World Cup.Victory at Allianz Stadium maintains England's invincible aura over France, which could prove pivotal come September in that potential semi-final meeting in Bristol.It was also Aldcroft's final chance to lift a trophy in the same venue that hosts the World Cup final, as Mitchell's grand plan for 2025 remains on track by the finest of margins.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Oops! Six Nations trophy falls apart again'The Six Nations needed that finish' - what they saidFormer England fly-half Katy Daley-McLean on BBC Two: "At one point I didn't want to look. Fair play to France. The game needed that finish, the Six Nations needed that finish. We don't see England under pressure that often but they delivered."Maggie Alphonsi, 2014 World Cup winner on BBC Two: "The Six Nations needed that jeopardy. It was a proper Test match and England should be proud the way they dug deep to win. They had to grind it out and you want that test before a World Cup."Former England head coach Simon Middleton on BBC TV: "It wasn't the game England would have wanted but they have worked so hard and put so much effort in they deserve this [success]. Former England hooker Brian Moore on BBC TV: "France gave so much to the game but it is about winning and England got over the line. In the first half there were periods where England did things very well but what they did not do is defend well enough at the breakdown. France played high risk rugby and it very nearly paid off."Line-upsEngland: Sing; Dow, Jones, Heard, MacDonald; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Atkin-Davies, Muir, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), Feaunati, Matthews.Replacements: Cokayne, Clifford, Bern, Galligan, Burton, L Packer, Aitchison, Rowland.France: Bourgeois; Grisez, M Menager, Vernier, Arbwy; Arbez, Bourdon; Brosseau, Bigot, Khalfaoui, M Feleu (capt), Fall-Raclot, Escudero, Champon, T Feleu.Replacements: Riffonneau, Mwayembe, Bernadou, Zago, Berthoumieu, Maka, Chambon, Queyroi.Referee: Maggie Cogger-Orr (NZ)TMO: Quinton Immelman (SA)Related topicsRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 687Top storiesLive. Reaction, analysis and your views as Liverpool crowned Premier League champions8803 viewing8.8k viewing'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Published13 hours ago'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCOn the frontline with the London Ambulance ServiceGo behind the scenes of the Time Lord's adventuresYour first look at the final series of Man Like MobeenGary Lineker reflects on 25 years of Match of the DayElsewhere in Sport'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen?Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?Meet the heavyweight who teaches sign languageThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'Eubank narrowly beats Benn - extended highlights.
